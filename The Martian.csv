  When six astronauts from the Ares 3 mission land on Acidalia Planitia, a flat area on the planet Mars, they expect to leave after about 30 days. Then a serious storm blows in, creating chaos and causing the mission to be abandoned within the first week. During the storm, astronaut Mark Watney, a botanist and mechanical engineer, is injured while the team struggles to get to the Mars Ascent Vehicle, and all signs indicate that he is dead as he lies there in the red dust. Soon afterwards, he regains consciousness only up to find himself alone and the sole inhabitant of an entire planet. This should have been petrifying but Mark Watney is an amazingly resourceful survivor and, despite everything, manages to maintain a rather quirky sense of humour throughout his ordeal. Meanwhile, the other Ares 3 crew members are on their way to Earth and mourning his loss, while Mindy Park from SatCon on Earth notices that a satellite is picking up some rather unusual occurrences happening on Mars.I knew that The Martian by Andy Weir was achieving high ratings and that it was to be a movie starring Matt Damon (excellent choice) but I had no idea it was going to be so engaging and so frequently hilarious. Author, Andy Weir, certainly has a witty way of expressing himself and as Weir's words appear in Watney's mind and tumble out of Watney's mouth, all I could do was laugh. There is some tension in the book (will Watney survive or not) but not much. Mostly it's an awful lot of scientific explanation as to how Watney strives to survive and NASA strive to help him. I found that fascinating but if you aren't the least bit interested in even basic science, I cannot imagine you'll get much out of this book. I appreciated the way Andy Weir used science fact to get his character both in and out of the tightest corners and to make the story more plausible. What was sadly lacking was a glossary of terms at the back of the book. Weir uses a lot of scientific terminology, not to mention acronyms, and mostly without any explanation. While reading, I did wonder though why Mark Watney had a problem with his space suit only giving him oxygen?I also wondered how a botanist and mechanical engineer, would know so much about chemistry and physics—but it's a good thing he did! I expect that the author did resort to at least some artistic license here.Before buying the paperback, I had bought the Kindle version. There is a map at the front of the book (printed and ebook). On the ebook, if you click on the map you can zoom in, in order to be able to see detail better. The Kindle dictionary came in useful, as did the facility for highlighting and making notes, as well as doing searches of the book. But I still wanted a printed version on one of my bookshelves, so I bought that recently. I once had a movie blog and actually wrote myself a guide to the terms in the book because, well, I'm no scientist and I wanted to understand the science behind everything that Weir threw at me! I've pasted in a text version here.

  Outstanding. I read this having already seen the film, and that sometimes means the book loses some of its impact - however even then it did not disappoint. It is hard to praise this enough – in fact I rarely write a review without some quibble (nothing’s perfect, right?) but in this case even if I have one or two doubts, it is so good I’m happy to let it go. The summary above of “Robinson Crusoe on Mars”, does the story an injustice.Mark Watney a botanist-astronaut, lands on Mars as part of the six strong crew on the third manned mission to Mars, a thirty-day mission ahead. However, a vicious Martian sandstorm forced the mission to be abandoned on day 6, but a freak accident means he is left stranded on Mars. Alone and far from safety, it will take all Watney’s knowledge and ingenuity if he wants to survive on Mars, long after he was supposed to leave.I disagree with the review below saying you can’t enjoy this if you aren’t interested in science – the writing makes the science part of the story, and this is the reason I rate this so highly. Weir manages to make the science interesting, even though there is a lot of science, it is not at the expense of the story. He explores Watney’s moods, his exploration of the local area and beyond, his ‘leisure-time’ and his desperate attempts to stay alive. Watney's gallows humour and unwillingness to look facts in the face (i.e. that he is going to die) and give up make you care about him.I think one of the reasons this book is so popular, and certainly why I liked is it makes Mars feels so tantalizingly close. It is barely sci-fi – technically speaking most of the stuff in the book is feasible now – it's more political will holding back a manned mission to Mars (and cash, but it is politicians who allocate the cash). There are no warp drives, lasers, aliens (hope that's not a plot spoiler) or other staples of sci-fi – just a guy trying to get home after getting stranded.I have just finished Artemis, Weir’s second novel (pretty good), and it has made me want to re-read The Martian, so my Kindle unread folder will remain undiminished for the next few days. If you haven’t read it, I cannot recommend highly enough.

  Having just come off the back of watching the film, I’ve done what everyone else has no doubt been doing, and read the book. Is it entertaining? Yes. Is it funny? Yes. Is it amazing writing? Well… no.The book and is carried on the witticisms and banter of main character Mark Watney, the titular Martian, and are jam-packed with pop culture references, science-y bits, and one-line zingers. And whilst I appreciated them, even found them amusing, this is also the story’s downfall. It sounds like the kind of dialogue I’d exchange with my equally nerdy friends on a Saturday night meet up – not Apollo 13 on Mars as it was billed to me by the hype. As a result it feels like it’s missing a sense of epic scale, and the stakes just don’t feel that high. At no point did I ever feel awed, or gripped, or really worried for Watney. Whenever something went wrong I simply wondered how he was going to fix it this time and what amusing commentary he’d provide. I never worried for a minute about his ultimate survival. Fun and entertaining? Yes. Compelling and thrilling? No.The writing is competent, not outstanding. Apart from the complicated science-y bits, the language is kept simple, which is good for accessibility of the average reader, but for me I felt it lacked a little bit of creative flair – the language is very functional and to the point, there’s very little evocative imagery or creative description. The characters are largely functional too. Outside of Watney, everyone else basically boils down to their job at NASA or their role (e.g. Mark’s parents, Vogel’s wife, etc.). Watney himself is interchangeable – his vital stats could be swapped out for someone older/younger male/female American/non-American and there be no difference whatsoever to what happens in the plot.Would I recommend this book? Yes, I would. It’s amusing, it’s entertaining, it’s interesting – it’s just not the most amazing, earth-shattering book ever written, so don’t go into it expecting that. It reminds me a lot of an old classic actually – The Moon Is Hell by John Campbell – in its diary format and its functional problem-solving (minus the crime solving that also goes on in Campbell’s novel).

  I watched the film first but then went for the book. I recommend doing it the other way around. Due to an eye problem I had to switch to the audio book part way through. I started from the beginning and found it’s much more engaging and I cared more about Mark when his diary entry is being performed and his humour comes accross. The story is good however you read it but I’d go for the audible book over the paper version. I don’t want to tell you the story beyond a guy is stuck on Mars and assumed dead and he’s making diary entries and trying to figure out how to survive. The audiobook works best because the entries are performed so well. It’s not an amazing piece of writing that’s going to be studied in a hundred years but you’re going to have fun reading it and like the guy, you really want him to survive and care about his journey, he never loses his sense of humour and it makes him much more likeable. I really recommend it, thanks for reading my review.

  I read Artemis recently, and found it very good. I then saw that this was by the same author. I really enjoyed the film, and I really liked the style of writing in Artemis, so I gave this a go. Even though I know how it turns out, I really enjoyed the book, it manages to describe very technical issues without seeming to get bogged down in nerdy details, and really conveys the situation brilliantly. The way that such large pieces of the book are merely the stranded man's thoughts with no interaction or dialogue with other people, and yet remain so engaging, is really clever. I will be seeking out other books by this author now.

  Spoiler free review:I saw a recommendation that if I liked the writing of the book Ready Player One, I'd probably like Artemis, so I thought since I loved RPO and it's world building, I'd try read to Andy Weir's the Martian first, having not seen the film yet either, and it being his better known work. I was absolutely not disappointed! The Martian has shot right up there to be one of my favourite books. Mark Watney is such a believable, funny and smart character, and the book made me feel actually afraid for him when things kept going wrong, made me laugh at all of his wisecracks, and make me root for him to keep going in the face of continuous almost certain of death. The book felt so real constantly with the level of description, including the day to day tasks, descriptions of fixing things, and how all the characters reacted to the situation (the crew and NASA namely).Weir does an excellent job at explaining the science (however accurate I have no idea, but it was reader friendly enough that it didn't make me feel alienated, pardon the pun) and building the tension. He fleshed out the characters very well, and I have to say that Watney grew on me so much that by the time I finished the book, I was incredibly sad to put it down and be finished with reading all of Watney's logs. If you want a really great space fiction book, this is definitely one for you. I didn't want to put it down (nor finish it!) and it made me look forward to my commute every day.I'll definitely be checking out Artemis too.

  This book was fantastic sci-fi and contained a really original and innovative premise to develop from. The amount of scientific information is a lot but it was crucial to convey the enormity of the situation Mark Watney found himself in. He is a traned astronaut and botanist after all. The content of the book would appeal to readers who have an interest in science and can appreciate the scientific data. I can understand the readers who are not scientically minded would find this book hard to enjoy. This book could have had more descriptive prose but it was excellent nevertheless. It was great to read the experiences of existing on Mars. Andy Weir has good technical knowledge and this was put to good use in the content of this book to describe Mark's journey back to salvation. Cheers to Andy for a great book!!

  I bought this because I really liked the film starring Matt Damon. It's mainly a series of dear diary moments from the stranded astronaut,  Mark Watney, with a ""normal"" book style when it goes back to the perspective of people on planet Earth. The pacing is perfect,  we get  days with Mark and it cuts back to Houston back on Earth when the dear diary moments are getting repetitive,  who are trying to help their stranded botanist. By the end of the book I cared about his survival and the feelings of the people who left him behind. Plenty of jokes made by Mark which I myself would have made in that position, which reinforced my empathy for him as he was all by himself on the red planet. All in all, one of my favourite books, it was engrossing and because of that,  I finished it in 2 days.

  I full on loved this book, the nerdy blog style writing was brilliant and I don't think I wanted anyone to live more than Mark Watney - he had so many odds against him and I think he may be my new favourite book protagonist, because he's hilarious.It was really easy to get into this book, and you really get invested in him being rescued!The other characters are good supports too, and it all flows between Mars, Hermes and at Earth.I really recommend this book tbh, specially for some of the one liners that the character whips out.""As with most of life's problems, this one can be solved by a box of pure radiation.""""Only an idiot would keep that thing near the Hab.

  So I have NOT seen the movie. Although I probably will now.I know this gets a 5 from everyone. And I am not damning it with faint praise by giving it 4. It’s very good. And if you a science geek a true sci fi nerd or just into engineering and fixing stuff you will score it a 5.At one point I struggled. And I know why. At the start it was too much sci and not enough fi ( for my taste).But what Weir does brilliantly is create a protagonist we really care about and throw disaster at him at a constant pace. At some point it’s a page turner and I couldn’t put it down. But I confess that to achieve that I skimmed a lot of stuff hat science and engineering aficionados would have dropped over. Sorry.But focusing on the human element was what worked for me - and the human element is very well done.This book doesn’t need my recommendation but it has it anyway

  A decent story let down from a read that did not absorbed me. An interest in science and space and reading novels in general left me underwhelmed on a technical and emotional aspect where it comes up short slightly for me.The story is refreshing in the fact that it is based mostly if not entirely on current technology. It is also refreshing as it is written in a fairly light hearted way with a big pinch of realism taking a leaf out of films such as gravity.It just lacks that special something and it is ultimately let down by a lack of inspiration. At no point did I feel the main character suffered at any time. This is unusal as this book blindly refuses to aknowledge any suffering concentrating on the human spirit. This however maybe a reflection on the main characters personality that he refused to suffer.....but still that nagging feeling that the main character would have suffered to the point it would have affected their personality. Because of that, the book could not make me believe anything of what it was saying. A bit harsh maybe as I have not lived in space so how would I know. Worth a read.

  This is a science fiction story that features absolutely no marauding aliens (or any aliens at all), but is still a gripping page-turner that will keep you reading to find out what happens. And for full enjoyment, you will need to pay close attention to the many technicalities that provide the bedrock of the story, as the protagonist goes through the detailed calculations needed to maximise his chances of surviving alone in the hostile enviroment of Mars. The story is a most intriguing and original one, with a resolution that feels exactly right.

  It's not surprising that this book has been a best seller. In this day and age, when we are bogged down with recessions and have almost forgotten projects like ITER and a manned mission to Mars, its good to remember that man can achieve a great deal. Landing on Mars is now inevitable and will soon be reality, so this is not science fiction. It's a thriller.Hats off to Weir for an incredible amount of research and faithfulness to the detail of space exploration. I don't even like to think of how hard he had to work to make this happen. I felt gripped from page one and found it very easy to read.Having said that, by the middle of the book, I was beginning to have doubts. Where was Mark Watney's family in all this? And why does his mood of optimism and good humour never change? Surely somebody spending years on Mars, alone, with little hope of rescue, would have days of terrible doubt and loneliness. But no, Watney is always 'up.'I became dubious about even the technical stuff when the Chinese probe came into the story. It appears China does have metric equivalents for measuring length and these may well be used in the space industry (I have no idea), but even if they are, simply the tolerance amounts would create very probable disasters, if they were to hook up a Chinese probe to a NASA one. We saw these issues with the A380 by Airbus and the problems would be far worse with a space probe.At the end of the book, I badly needed to know more about the people around Watney. The tech stuff was relentless and I wanted to know whether he had a girlfriend and what she might be thinking.The last part is technically a bit of a stretch too.A few too many one-liners for my liking, but hey, that is the fashion at the moment, courtesy of James Bond, I guess.But its a great book. Only lacking the last star from me, because the writers didn't dig into the human emotion side of the experience enough.

  Having seen the movie first and then read the book, although I enjoyed the movie for what it was, the book was a much more satisfying and enjoyable experience.That's not to say it's without its flaws. I found the beginning where it is more or less exclusively filled with Watneys logs, a bit of a slog. I also thought the amount of technical detail gone into when problem solving was needed(quite often as you can imagine from the subject matter) was over the top and unnecessary, perhaps to the point where my interest would wane and I'd find myself hoping the in depth description of the technicalities of solving the particular problem would be over as soon as possible.The story does really open up when NASA and its employees are brought in and indeed its other employees in outer space(Watneys crew mates)on the Hermes. The dynamic becomes much better and the story becomes much better fleshed out and enjoyable.Despite my criticisms, I still found this a cracking read overall and was fully engaged 90% of the time. You really do find yourself rooting for Watney, which is always a good sign. I read this in about a week, which is very good going for me, so that says to me that I did really enjoy this book and so I've given it a just about deserved four stars.

  I did a bad thing and watched the movie before reading the book. I honestly wasn't even interested in reading the book until I watched the film though. The film was pretty true to the book I felt.I'm sure you know what the Martian is about but if you don't it's about a guy called Mark Watney who gets stranded on Mars after his crew thinks that he died. The next mission to Mars isn't for 5 years and he only has enough rations for 1-2 years.I was worried after watching the film how they would explain all the science stuff in the books, I'm pretty good at understanding science related wording because I studied science a lot in school. It honestly was fairly straight forward, there was a lot of jargon but it was explained for the most part. However after a while I found my mind numbing with all the jargon, there was just so much. I get that it's science fiction, I get that it's all about getting a man back from being stranded on Mars, but honestly some of it was hard work. I didn't have trouble understanding it, it was just tiring.Despite the tiring jargon though it really felt like something that was actually happening. It felt like it was all in the realm of possibility, and I really felt myself getting to the edge of my seat sometimes, even though I knew what was going to happen.Something I really adored about this book was how funny Mark was. Honestly his humour was right up my street, he's a smart ass and I love reading people like that in books.The rest of the characters were pretty diverse but also they kind of felt non existent sometimes. I couldn't remember who all he people working at NASA were and who was what part of the team.I think the film and the book are pretty on par in my opinion, which doesn't happen often. So if you can't be bothered to read all the info but could sit through a movie, you should watch the movie, if you aren't a movie person the book is good too.

  The Martian, saw the film first and was engaged throughout and enjoyed it. The book however was something else. I did the sample thing for some reason, read that within 5 mins then bought the book. Its been a while since a good read has had me laughing out loud, (funny looks from ""Joe Public"" time.)The gallows humour is dark, well it would be stuck on Mars. The lengths our lonely hero (space pirate), goes to to survive is brilliant, clever, unorthodox but above all gripping, including setting fire to stuff and nearly killing himself. NASA, for two months forgot about him then did everything possible to get him home. They were not entirely happy with his butchery of expensive equipment and made it known, then send him up to meet a rescue ship in an open tin can of fuel.....yup thats right. His crew mates had no option but to abandon him to survive themselves. The feeling of loss and guilt takeover until they find out he's alive and mutiny to rescue him.Some of the science stuff went over my head (I'm not a rocket scientist, biologist, astronaut or a member of NASA),  but it was written easy enough to understand. The film does follow the book for the most part.  This is for me a book I will not tire of reading over and over again. Try it, you may surprise yourself.

  I tend to stay away from hard Science Fiction, which is defined as fiction that’s limited by the technology that we have or can prove at this point in time, and as such can be worked into the realm of science fact.  It’s not that I’m in love with ray guns and warp drives, it’s that I tend to read for the thrill of the unknown, and when something isn’t an unknown, it’s not quite so thrilling.But, in the interest of coming out of the comfort zone, I picked up a copy of the Martian, mainly for the opening line on the preview, which reads…“I’m pretty much f*****”Sometimes all you need is a good tagline…It’s the story of the first manned expedition to Mars, and an accident that befalls the mission when the weather conditions prove to be more severe than expected.  One of the crew, Mark Watney, is left behind on the planet, presumed dead following being separated from the others in a massive storm.Except he’s not dead.What follows is the explanation of how he finds himself alone on Mars with supplies for six people for 31 days, needing to make them last for at least four years so that mission control might be able to send a team back to rescue him.  Note that word, explanation, because there’s a lot of that going on in this book, not to be confused with exposition, and that for me is the cornerstone of Hard science fiction, the proof that the things going on in the book can be done.Don’t get me wrong, I have no ability in the scientific disciplines that are used in the book, so I can’t speak for the veracity of the equations or the botanical conundrums that are described, but a whole bunch of people who do have that knowledge have spoken praise of the accuracy, so that’s good enough for me.It would have been easy to imagine a scenario where nothing goes wrong and science wins the day, but Andy Weir hasn’t taken the easy way out on this, throwing problem after problem against Watney.  Each time coming up with an accurate scientific solution for how Watney could make a success out of it, from explosions within the base to miscalculations of minute degrees that make a massive difference, everything is about the science, how it can save us if done right, destroy us if done wrong.Given that the book is pretty much one man and his thoughts on the surface, there’s very little in the way of dialogue in the book, and as a result, a lot of what’s going on is only communicated through the logs of Mark Watney, and therein lies the problem for me. The problem with communicating in Logs is that everything is past tense, you know he got through it because there’s the log to show how he did it, and while there’s nothing wrong with writing in past tense, it loses some of the tension that present tense would bring with it.  It’s not till the end of the book when the action is happening in real time that we get some idea of the man that we’ve been reading about and not just the notes that he kept on what had happened. Like any journal, it’ll tell you what happened, but it won’t put the emotion of the moment on the page.  There are a few moments of live action, and those moments were well done, giving some much needed life to Watney, but not as many as I felt there should have been.  A lot of the action would have been much better in real time rather than reading about it later.Then there’s the character of Mark Watney, who is intelligent, resourceful, and has the exact mindset and skillset to survive on the planet.  I understand that leaving the medical technician or comms specialist on the planet would have had them dead after the food ran out and that doesn’t make for a good story, but Watney is exceptional in all the things he needs to be, and he does have luck on his side in a number of places.  I found myself not fearing for Watney, because his assured view is that science can and will overcome everything, a viewpoint that he proves on a number of occasions, but given that science is his ally, there was a lack of tension in the book (for me) as a result.It’s heavy going in places where the science is going on, particularly when you don’t really understand if what he’s saying is accurate or applied phlebotinum, but it’s an enjoyable read, worth getting through the grinding bits for the ending, and certainly the first Hard science fiction novel that I’ve read that I enjoyed.One thing I would say is that it’s getting made into a film, and I’ve seen the trailer, from which the line, “I’m going to have to science the s*** out of this…” leads me to believe that Hollywood have their claws into it to make it less like the novel and more like a cheerful version of Interstellar. In truth, as much as I like things happening in real time, I believe the novel was how this story was meant to be told, and I would urge everyone to read the book before seeing the film.

  I can't even comprehend the amount of research that must've gone into this book. Andy Weir writes in such detail it's easy to forget that no one has ever been to Mars, let alone lived there!The first I heard of The Martian was when the film was released - I haven't seen it - I have a little personal rule of always reading a book before seeing the film version! I found though that when I downloaded it, I was in no rush to read it. When I finally got round to reading it, I was surprised how quickly and how much I started to enjoy it.Mark Watney's character is brilliant. A wonderfully courageous, admirable, incredibly intelligent, determined, loyal, hilarious man who finds himself trying to survive against the odds after an emergency evacuation goes wrong and he is left alone on Mars with no way to communicate with NASA back on Earth.Whenever Mars throws up a problem or something that could kill him, Mark's attitude and personality are what sees him through. He has a few little momentary panics and then just gets on with it and saves his own life time and time again. He is relentless in finding solutions to the problems Mars throws at him ... and there are a lot!All the characters in this book are brilliant - they're all so wonderfully determined, loyal and ridiculously intelligent that it makes The Martian a joy to read. A whole planet rooting for one man and trying everything possible to get him home. Just brilliant!I especially liked the parts of this book written from the perspective of inanimate objects like the Hab material, the emergency food packs and the MAV. These were so cleverly written helping you understand what is happening and why and it was actually really refreshing to read from this perspective.There is A LOT of scientific information in this book but if like me, you're totally clueless about science and space, it is easy enough just to skim read through those parts and be able to pick up the gist of what is happening.Even at 90%, I wasn't sure how The Martian would end. With everything thrown at him it seems impossible that Mark will get home...The Martian is a brilliant story of space travel, human spirit, loyalty, determination and courage. Wonderfully enjoyable even if you don't understand the science bits!

  Enjoyable examination of how people survive in a hostile environment - eat your hearts out, Ray Mears and Bear Grylls!  I haven't seen the film yet, which may be a good thing, but I'm sure I'm not giving any spoilers when I say this book is a mixture of personal log entries by our Martian Robinson Crusoe, and third person narratives relating the efforts of the rest of the human race to bring him home safely.I have read reviews of this book complaining about the amount of sciency bits which comprise a large chunk of our hero Mark Watney's narrative but these complaints seem rather bizarre.  If the reviewers wanted a lot of navel-gazing emoting such content would be better placed on a tropical island where the castaway's problems would be limited to deciding which coconut to eat and which tanned maiden to cop off with.  Introspection and angst are obviously of no use to a person whose life is a constant battle against suffocation, exploding in low pressure and starving in an abiotic environment.  It is Mark Watney's boyish enthusiasm and adolescent sense of humour which gets him through situations which would daunt most of us - if he stopped to think about how he needed to work on his relationship with his father/secretary/milkman he'd give up and die by default.In addition to being the sort of chap you'd have a laugh with down the pub, Watney is, like most of the people who get sent into space, a resilient, well-trained and resourceful chap.  No situation confronts him for which he cannot find some ingenious if flawed solution.  But the scope of his exile is enormous, and it is by no means certain that even his inventiveness and the combined genius of NASA and other can save him from a long, long period alone and without re-supply.The book contains quite a lot of rude words - fairly obviously, as I'd be swearing a lot if I was stuck on Mars facing a near certainty of death - so beware about offering it to young space-mad kids to read.  And there's no romance or sex in it, unsurprisingly.  The science is frequent - well-explained but possibly in larger quantities than some people can handle, but frankly, what would you expect?In short, I found this an interesting and absorbing book, and I was rooting for Mark Watney pretty much from page 1.

  I thought as a scientist I would find most of the concepts in this book far fetched and unrealistic, but I was pleasantly surprised. For the most part, the events seemed somewhat plausible. More importantly, Andy Weir writes with a simplicity that can incorporate comedy in the most dire of circumstances. I couldn't put the book down and was alternating between laughing and fist clenching at the anticipation of what would happen next. I felt like I was right there with Watney trying to figure out what to do. Loved it!

  The Martian is a fascinating work of fiction which engenders a lot of guffaws upon reading it. It is a fascinating look at one man's struggle against the combined forces of an entire planet.Mark Watney makes for an excellent protagonist. He's relatable, humorous and takes to his deranged set of circumstances with surprising aplomb. Like me, you too will be rooting for Watney; finding it difficult to stop reading to find out how he'll tackle the next hurdle in front of him.And Weir's writing style is one that is both informal and familiar. Almost as if he just transcribed actual conversations because they feel so natural. Furthermore, there is a flow to it that makes putting the book down difficult. Furthermore, the entire book is just riddled with NASA lexicon and descriptions of space technology; something I'm personally fascinated by.A definite buy for any book worm!

  Apparently I’m easily read because having just met someone they recommended this book and they were dead on. It’s only just barely sci-fi, in that most of the science in it would actually work and hence, isn’t quite fiction. Sure, there’s plenty of speculation, no one has ever been stuck on Mars before, but that’s ok because it’s not supposed to be a documentary.If you’ve somehow missed it, the gist of the story is this: A group of astronauts visit Mars, they are the third such group to do so, so in theory this should be getting routine. Except that space is dangerous. Things go wrong during a storm in which Mark Watney, our protagonist, is flung away from the group by a piece of debris. His vital signs monitor drops offline and, after an attempt to find him by the captain, he is presumed dead. The remaining team have no choice but to leave him behind.However, that would make for a very short story. So, you’ll forgive me for the not-really-a-spoiler when I tell you that he isn’t dead. When he comes to he has to figure out to survive on Mars, a planet that seems awfully dedicated to killing astronauts.It’s refreshing in that Watney’s drive is purely survival. There’s no love interest, no wife and kids back home he has to survive for. He doesn’t need to prove himself to the folk who never believed in him. He doesn’t need to survive so he can save the world. He just doesn’t want to die in space. Honestly, that seems like motivation enough to me, but it’s definitely a bit of a relief that it’s that simple.To me, it reads a bit like a (thoroughly coherent and well thought out) long chat in the pub. Like, you somehow get onto a conversation with your friends which goesFriend 1: Ok, well if your plane crashed in the Amazon how would you survive?Friend 2: I don’t know? Is it a passenger jet? Or a tiny bi-plane?Friend 1: A passenger jet, why?Friend 2: Ok, that’s good. Someone’s got waterproofs in their suitcase, I can use those to keep dry and to collect clean water when it rains. I can siphon jet fuel to start firesFriend 3: You’ll blow yourself upFriend 2: Ok… um, let me think…And on and on. Except on Mars instead of in the Amazon. It’s one guy figuring out how to use science and common sense (although he sometimes lacks the other) to survive long enough to get back home.It’s an easy read, I read it really quickly and I found myself actively making time to go read more of it. That hasn’t happened with a book in a while. Consequently I fell through it in about a week, which is pretty good going for me, I don’t find myself with a huge number of opportunities to read. I’ve also now become one of those people who wants everyone else to read it, which has to be a good sign, right?Oh, and compared to the movie? Well, I preferred the book because there’s more in it. However, the movie doesn’t stray that far from the book and (thank goodness) doesn’t feel the need to add a love interest. So it’s all good. I enjoyed the movie as well. Go see it if you don’t fancy reading the book, I won’t judge you.

  Mark Watney is stranded on Mars left behind by his crew who believed him dead. He is in a base (think large tent) designed to last 31 days. If the water reclaimer breaks, he dies. If the oxygenator breaks, he dies. He only has enough food to last a year but it's 4 years until the next mission. Oh and his satellite radio is broken. This diary style novel tells his story.I love the premise of this novel, I thought it would be quite depressing to read but I was very, very wrong. Andy Weir gives Watney gallows humour and that changes the whole feel. He made me laugh, I didn't cry and it provoked me into thinking how I would feel put in the same situation, would I be as resourceful (well, obviously not as I'm not a trained biologist and engineer and I'm not an astronaut).If you're not a science geek, stay strong through the technical explanation of how water is created from small explosions, how smearing your own cr*p over Martian soil makes it alive with microbes to support a potato crop. You will be rewarded by a surprisingly realistic story, and you will totally be rooting for Mark to survive and make it home.

  Mark Watney is stuck on Mars with no hope of rescue. He has no comms and only enough food to last a month. The next mission to Mars is years away. When he gets over the gravity of the situation (excuse the pun) Mark gets to work planning how to survive long enough to get back in contact with NASA.Mark is a sarcastic and humorous in his communications. His tenacity and resourcefulness is admirable. The other crew members were also well developed considering their relative contributions.I loved this book and can't wait to see the film. The science of space travel isn't overwhelming at all, but obviously I can't vouch for its validity. I'm sure Andy Weir spent a great deal of time researching and immersing himself in the details. I was completely convinced by it.Despite the technical details it is still a reasonably easy read and I finished it in two sittings. By the end of the book I was on the edge of my seat as the tension increased to a dramatic conclusion. Overall an easily accessible and thoroughly gripping sci-fi thriller, and another favourite to add to my list.For more of my reviews visithttps://mrsredsreviews.wordpress.com

  What a great book!I must admit I am a total geek and this book suited me down to the ground - without giving anything major away the premise is that a member of a Mars exploration mission is accidently left on the planet when the crew think he has died in an accident.  The survivor awakes to find that the mission has been aborted and he has been left alone on the planet - with only enough resources to last a few months.This is where it gets geeky - the survivor has to use all his science, maths and MacQyvering abilities to learn how to survive in this hostile wilderness - from growing his own food, to getting radio comms with earth, to working out an escape plan - its all there in great scientific detail.There is also a humour side to this story as it is written almost entirely as a narrative as the survivor dictates all of his thoughts into the mission log - and sometimes these musings made me literally laugh out loud.In conclusion a great gem of a book that gets you thinking - and having seen the film adaptation I recommend this book totally as the film does miss out quiet a bit of detail (and whole sections of the text) in order to make it a bit more Hollywood (its still a good film though!).

  I wasn't too sure what expect and I am usually wary of novels that have just been adapted for film; the reviews were mixed as well. However, on the fairly safe recommendation of a colleague, I gave it a go.Pleasantly surprised. The technical detail, and there is a lot, seemed plausible and grounded in research. Far from being boring, it's an intrinsic element and without it, the book just wouldn't work. My opinion and I'm not an engineer or a scientist. It didn't drag and every time our unfortunate, stranded astronaut seems to have finally run out of lives and amazingly inventive, life saving fixes.......well, I won't plant any spoilers but suffice to say, I was riveted.It's not all Mars based lone survival scenes; we also get to know the ground team and the crew he was separated from.The race to the conclusion was genuinely full of tension although I felt the ending was a bit too neat. This didn't spoil my overall satisfaction at all though. So, to conclude, not high literature but very, very good story telling and a good Kindle copy.

  There is a lot of applied science in this book, which even although it is probably beyond most people (myself included!) to understand, that still manages to be interesting:  Some of it may be made up (I don't have the technical knowledge to say and this is after all an imaginary episode on Mars!) but the way the information is presented, and the whole book is narrated, is very engaging and entertaining.  It is also a great story of perseverence in the face of adversity, and kept me gripped, literally to the last page.

  Mark Watney is on Mars. Alone. With no way of communicating with earth, limited food and water and no get-out-of-jail-free card. So how does this make a book that is fascinating, action-packed and with a main character that I came to hugely admire? Through the magnificent storytelling of Andy Weir is how.After a disastrous attempt to leave Mars, Mark Watney finds himself injured, alone and without any contact with either his colleagues or the command station on earth. No communication, limited food and water, and years away from another Mars landing, he could have easily just turned into a whiny, self-pitying drag of a character. Instead, he pulls himself together, takes stock of what he does have to work with, and sets about setting himself up to survive as long as possible. As a botanist/mechanical engineer, he’s got knowledge and skills, but not necessarily the right ones to get him off the planet. This however, is what I loved about him as a character – he used what he did have to try and solve his problems, rather than moaning about what he didn’t have. He’s also rather humorous, in that black, sarcastic kinda way that I’m a huge fan of.At the same time, his never ending cheerfulness and optimism does get a little wearing at times. He does occasionally wallow in a bit of self pity, but it’s only to swear at himself and the situations a few times before picking up his tools and getting back on with the job of surviving.Being a science fiction book set on Mars, with a focus on surviving using technology, there is a lot of science-y stuff and explanations. Normally, this would completely turn me off, but Weir does a good job in making it both understandable and relevant to the story – some of the explanations are rather long, but also quite fascinating.In short, I actually shouldn’t have liked this book as much as I did, if I based it on the facts that 1) there’s pretty much one main character 2) there’s a LOT of technical stuff and 3) it’s set in space, and that’s not usually something that appeals to me. However, I really like and admired Mark as a character, got sucked in to the technical parts rather than skimming over them (or worse, giving up completely) and I was desperately to find out what would happen. Even if you aren’t a fan of science fiction, I can definitely recommend The Martian – it took me by surprise just how much I enjoyed it.

  This book is brilliant - even if you have watched the film. There is so much more detail in the book and arguably better situations; (spoilers) in the book Matt daeeemon fries the only method of communication back to earth so he has to guess what needs done rather than be told, which is great and in addition - the rover flips in the book en route to evac point, whereas in the film he just drives there no bother.

  This is extended novel version.  Our narrator even references the event (""NASA learned their lesson... all filters are interchangable"").There is a lot of excessive technical detail thrown about - I didn't really care about the square footage of soil required to grow 952 potatoes, and considering he insists on ""sparing [us] the math"", he relies an awful lot on the minutia of statistics and other mathematical details.  But that doesn't always detract from the story - it's this detail that means we are more able to understand the desperate improvisation required to stay alive so many miles from Earth, when no one else realises he's still alive.  He has to survive knowing that rescue is NOT immediately on its way.I actually enjoyed this story.  I wanted to know what happened, how Mark would keep going long enough to make contact with Earth again, overcoming all the incredible bad (and good) luck that dogs the 400+ days he might end up stranded on an alien planet .  Yes, there are certain parts where the characters grated, or slipped into unbelievability, but the underlying plot was strong enough for me to grit my teeth and get through these occasional niggles.  I even liked the narrative technique of leaving us alone with only Mark's log for a significant portion of the novel, stranding us with just one perspective of the whole event just as Mark is stranded.  [small spoiler - after about halfway through we start getting a third person narrative of the events back on Earth, focusing on their rescue/recovery efforts].I wouldn't call this the greatest work of literature.  It's been made into a movie, directed by Ridley Scott and is already being compared to Prometheus (for both good and bad) - and I would agree that it's a mixed bag, some people are going to hate this, others are going to find it an enjoyable piece of action.  Personally, I read until it was finished, and was happy enough with the conclusion.  I won't recommend this, but I won't try and put anyone off either.

  I bought this on the back of trailer for the film – which I rarely do. It looked amazing, and it was.This can best be summed up as Robinson Crusoe in space.  In a future not too distant or improbable mankind is beginning to colonise Mars. It is still a hostile, alien world filled with danger but in the spirit of exploration and adventure that has marked humanity since the dawn of history this is merely a hindrance, not a barrier.  When one of their number is swept away, injured in a terrible storm the rest of the crew must make the difficult decision to leave a man behind – if they look for him then no one gets home.  This is not really their story.Watney, the man who was last seen disappearing in a dust storm, badly injured and left for dead is alone, light years from home on a planet determined to kill him. Rescue is years away, if it comes, and so he must use that determination and pioneering spirit which marks out his ilk. This is HIS story.  The excitement picks up quickly and does not let up.  Watney’s dark humour and positive disposition weave a spell on the reader, one wants him to meet the challenge, to survive and to do what no one has done before.Without wishing to give too much away the book progresses to NASA and Earth discovering his plight and he becomes the most famous man on two planets, as it were. Think of the real life coverage of the brave Apollo 13 crew – the whole world watched as they defied the odds and came home. That is the feeling here. I found myself unable to put the book down, and could imagine watching on TV as the story unfolded. I REALLY wanted Watney to survive. I really felt for his crew and his dilemma.There is some technical language – which is mostly explained in the diaryesque way of storytelling. It certainly doesn’t overwhelm the story and brings a sense of realism. It’s science fiction with a good dose of science fact.If I have a criticism it’s perhaps some of the minor characters are not nearly as well defined as Watney, but then again there is a big cast and this is not really their story.Overall – Excellent, exciting, well written and engaging.

  I read the sample and was hooked, I'm always tempted by a good survival story and this was an interesting change from a desert island. Astronaut Mark Watney gets left behind on Mars, presumed dead, when the crew abandon their mission in a storm. He has to use his skills as an engineer and botanist to work out how to survive 4 years till the next scheduled landing on Mars, oh, that also happens to be 3200 km away so how will he get there and will they actually come? Communication is broken so how can he contact earth? His food supplies will run out in months not years, what about oxygen, water etc etc...You don't need to be a science nut to understand the book but it helps if you have some interest in the science aspects. The author often reinforces statements to ensure you didn't forget something stated before, this starts off as annoying but later aids understanding the pure volume of science in this novel. It initially reminded me of many a TV programme that does the same thing, dumbing it down for all audiences. Also some statements are unnecessarily explained eg ""the solar cells were covered in sand rendering them useless"", is it really necessary to state after that "" hint : solar cells need sunlight to make electricity"", surely anyone would know that? He had already said there is enough food to feed six people for fifty days and explained as he's just one guy it'll last three hundred days. Later he goes on to say the spare oxygenator is intended to last five days before it saturates the filters, which means thirty days for him. Ok, that's fine, we already know he's on his own but we don't need the following reinforcement "" just one person breathing, instead of six"". You get the drift?Before long though it gets to a more complex chemistry scenario and extra explanations are very welcome. This means if you pay attention you are never really in danger of getting totally out of your depth and can lie back and enjoy the read (you could also let some of it wash over you without affecting the story if the science gets too much).There is a lot of lighthearted (and really quite juvenile) dialogue in The Martian which may not in keeping with Watney's predicament but it makes it very readable. However I could have done without words like yay, boo, tadaa and remember. The latter was used a lot to reinforce what had already been told, as in ""remember xyz that I told you about earlier"".With the wit and unflappable traits of the stranded astronaut it may not be for all hardened sci-fi fans but it should appeal to a more general readership. Whilst most explanations seem there for the general reader some basic explanations (that people interested in this subject will already know) are missed, most general readers will have heard of NASA, but what about JPL? He doesn't actually explain what Sol is from the beginning though most will realise from context it's a Mars day (which is 39 minutes longer than an earth day) and again from context you will get that JPL builds stuff for NASA but I had to google it to find out it stands for Jet Propulsion Laboratory which is the leading centre for robotic exploration of the solar system.I understand this will soon be a movie with Matt Damon (though I can't get Tom Hanks out if my head for the lead as its so Castaway meets Apollo 13 but I guess a younger actor is needed and I'm sure Matt Damon will be a very good choice). It will be interesting to see how they deal with the science explanations in the movie.Whilst I understand some of the negative reviews that said an experienced astronaut wouldn't speak or act the way he does I did feel it helped counterbalance the dry science, though at times he really was juvenile in his comments. Overall I thoroughly enjoyed The Martian and I'm looking forward to seeing the movie too. 4 1/2 stars.

  This is an excellent book. The story grabs you and you become immersed in the hopelessness then hopefulness (repeat a few times) of the only inhabitant of Mars, left behind by his fellow space astronauts when they head for home, thinking him dead. The story, in part is told by his log that details his fight for survival until those back on Earth can mount a rescue mission. His struggles to provide himself with the requirements of life with what he has to hand are fascinating and fraught with danger.There are those who are not too enamoured with the technical side of things as he alters and builds contraptions to provide himself with air and food amongst other things, but this is done in such a way that it's clear to even the most tech-ignorant amongst us. It becomes pretty quickly fascinating. Made even more so because of the way the logs are written, illustrating the humour of their author. As the book progresses, things become more critical and then builds up to a crescendo as we approach the planned escape.You'll have to forgive me for not following the story further in this review for obvious reasons, but I hope you can take my word that this is a book that is well worth reading that you will find riveting. It's no wonder it has been picked up and made into a movie. It'll no doubt be a success in a time when it is fashionable to make a space adventure film. But, the age old question, will the movie be better than the book? Seeing as how the movie at the time of writing is only soon to be released, I can't answer that, dear reader, but I can say that the movie will have to go some to beat this excellent book.

  Most people reading this book will already have seen the film, so let's get that out of the way first. The endings are different, and the last common scene happens slightly different in the cinema, but overall there's no huge difference between film and book. So, to the book......it's a great read. Being stranded on Mars, with most dialogue happening as monologue, is a hard trick to pull off and Weir manages it. Science geeks alert: the book goes much more deeply into science than the film, and it's truly fascinating. It's obvious Weir really did his homework on atmospherics, materials science, and other systems he details; even punching holes in a roof is explored in depth. Many of the ad-hoc engineering tasks Matt Damon, sorry, Mark Watney accomplishes are accompanied by actual numbers and reasoned explanations of the chemistry and physics.It won't be for everyone - if you're expecting Space Opera look away now - but the key factor here is how a desperate situation involving a lone astronaut has all the thrill and flair of a suspense novel. Whether you've seen the film or not, the book's a VERY worthwhile read.

  One of the best books I have read in a long time, if not ever. Gripping, fast paced, and delved straight into the science of the situation, without copping out and skimming over it. You don't need to fully understand the science to enjoy the story, but if you do, it enriches it further. Every solution to every problem was ingenious, and hugely entertaining.The main character was engaging, funny, and I was genuinely rooting for him from the start. The log entry method of telling the story allowed for the actual nuts and bolts of the situation to be concentrated on, without straying into melancholy and introspection, which the story didn't need. It must have been difficult for the author (being an experienced wordsmith) to adjust his writing style from that of an experienced author to that of someone who is quickly scribbling down log entries to record his experience. I appreciated the lack of simile and metaphor in the writing, I find these tools over used and a bit cliché nowadays.

  I bought this book because I had heard that the movie was coming out soon and I'm one of those people who need to read the book before watching the movie/TV show. I was not disappointed. This book is funny, irreverent and filled with tension that really, really ramps up to the max in the last 100 or so pages. The point of view changes between Mark Watney's logs to the events happening on Earth at NASA and the change keeps the pace of the story up and also allows the reader to breathe as we take a break from the science - of which there is a lot. I had read that this book is an insider favourite at NASA because of its incredible research. Apparently, Andy Weir took years to get everything just right, which makes this book a terrifying reality for future manned missions to Mars.With regards to Mark Watney, he does, in a way, remind me of Chris Hadfield of the ISS. He is relaxed, calm and funny. Some may find him unbelievable due to his easy reaction to the situations that often-times explode around him but having read Chris Hadfield's book and knowing the amount of training that astronauts undertake, Watney strikes me as an astronaut through and through. They are trained not to panic. They are trained to think calmly and clearly under extreme pressure and Watney comes through it all with an entertaining gallows humour.I cannot recommend this book highly enough. If you have an interest in space and Mars, this is for you. If you simply like books that you can't put down, this is also for you. I sped through this in a single day and was disappointed when I came to the last page. Please do read this. It is certainly worth the money.

  The Martian has been described as ""Robinson Crusoe in space"". However, we quickly realise that Mark Watney - the astronaut marooned on Mars - makes Defoe's hero look like a pampered, snivelling amateur.This book does so many things seamlessly:- It makes you believe in and care about the hero within 2 pages, enough so you worry about him and can't bring yourself to put the book down until you know his latest survivalist science stunt isn't going to kill him.- It juggles action on Mars, Earth and the Hermes (the craft the rest of Watney's crew mates are using to get back to Earth), often using different timelines, but all in a way that creates a clear, easy-to-follow narrative.- The pace is break-neck. We are dropped straight into Watney's predicament on page 1 and the narrative pressure rarely lets up.- It's surprisingly funny. There's some great dark humour which provides welcome comic relief.If I had to nitpick, I'd say that in a couple of places I could have done with less of the highly-technical scientific explanations. I found myself skimming down the page to find out what I really wanted to know: would Watney's current experiment kill him or not?But that's just me being difficult. Overall, The Martian is a tremendous accomplishment and a book I would recommend to everyone (and particularly anyone, like me, who likes sci-fi and wanted to be an astronaut).

  Excellent, thoroughly enjoyed this book. I will admit it may have something to do with loving the movie. Those images from the movie play their part. But what I found really interesting was the attention to detail. Now I'm no math genius, so I have no clue if half the stuff they talk about is true, real or accurate, but the style of writing keeps the story flowing, whilst giving the reader all available information. Mark is a great protagonist, smart (he is an astronaut) resourceful and is able to keep going with a sense of humour to match. Have you ever watch a movie or read a book where you said, Why didn't he just do.....well this book he tells you why he didn't do that, and why he's doing what he is, in great detail, which some people may not like. I'd recommend trying the sample first like I did, you won't regret it.

  Read this in one day, nearly one sitting.Loved it, truly drawn into the characters, the environment, everything.Willing him on every step of the way and cursing with him at all the disasters he has to overcome. The narrative was fantastic, laugh out loud funny in places as you were effectively reading his diary.I read this a while ago and never got round to posting the review, always thinking ""this would make a great movie"" !

  After having been very disappointed by Robocalypse, another attempt of a geek-turned-writer, I approached the book without much expectations.Granted, Andy Weir's prose reads like a secondary school literature assignment and any character development doesn't go beyond quips like ""I am f'cked"" or ""I hate disco"". But this is more than compensated for with the technical part of the whole book, i.e. a detailed description of how a stranded astronaut without any means of communication can leverage technology to survive for several years on a planet completely not suited for human survival.** SPOILERS **Mark Watney, the protagonist of the book, is  treated harshly by the author. Though he starts with an intact hab and some provisions, he needs to use all his ingenuity to stay alive far beyond the month-or-so guaranteed by his initial conditions. The author throws spanner to his works regularly - the hab is filled with explosive hydrogen while Watney turns hydrazine into water, then he manages to make contact with Earth, then he loses it again for good, then an airlock on his hab blows up, destroying his crops farm, then he needs to make an impromptu trip to a site about 3000 km away, he encounters a storm en-route (supposedly there are no storms in thin Martian atmosphere, but I can forgive this one inaccuracy) etc.And the author describes in no vague terms how to workaround all this seemingly insurmountable problems. If you are technically oriented person, you'll enjoy this.

  I don't often leave reviews for books but this one is just riveting.  I haven't finished it yet but in the 2 days I've had this book I'm over halfway through as I can hardly put it down, in fact, I was reading it on the bus home and didn't notice going past my bus stop and so I ended up having to get off and trudge back home.He is a man who through not just his intelligence but his optimism, nerve and rye sense of humour manages to survive.  I won't tell you how and what happens as you already know from watching the blockbuster movie this was made into but if you haven't seen the movie you will want to watch it after reading this.

  `The airlock`s on its side, and I can hear a steady hiss. So either it`s leaking or there are snakes in here. Either way, I`m in trouble`The idea of being stranded on Mars with some kit and having to improvise to survive is a fascinating one.At first I found the diary like daily status reports and our hero`s gung-ho attitude a bit wearisome, but as the story unfolded I soon changed my mind and found Watney quite inspiring. It has much to do with courage in the face of adversity and a sense of humour as well as the spirit of adventure. A great book in my opinion!

  I was recommended The Martian by a friend a little while ago, and finished it as a holiday book. A lot of readers find it almost impossible to put down: this was not quite my experience, though I have enjoyed reading it a great deal.The basic setting is that one member (Mark Watney) of a near-future manned Martian expedition is accidentally left on the planet when the crew have to abruptly abandon the mission. The story then follows Mark’s struggle for survival until the point where a rescue becomes possible. There is a long succession of crises that have to be faced and overcome by a mixture of hard work and inventiveness. Some of the time Mark is able to validate his plans with expert advice from NASA, but at other times he is purely on his own.The science and engineering aspects have been exceptionally well thought through, so far as I can tell. Mark is able to make creative and credible use of the materials at his disposal, which themselves are plausible for his original mission. To a very large extent the repeated crises drive the plot, and other issues such as character are largely in the background. We do get to learn quite a lot about Mark’s current frame of mind, but much less about his back story, or indeed that of any of the other peripheral characters. It is basically a “geek triumphs over adversity” story, and a splendid example of this.To a degree the story tails off towards the end. This is largely because the presenting issues are so large that the outcome is either total success or total failure (and hence death). The stakes keep growing, and the possibilities for successfully finding a way out get narrower.For me, this was a 4* book. It was very well planned out and executed, and a highly believable near-future scenario. Personally I prefer books with more character interaction, which by definition is not going to happen here. But many people will appreciate The Martian for its technical detail and long series of survival challenges.

  This was a rare trip into fiction for me having missed the film I was dying to see, I can only hope when I do see it, it lives up to this book.Superbly written keeping me on the edge of my seat for the whole amazing journey. I am a sci-fi nut so it certainly played to my fascination with off world stories but it did so in such a way that I simply couldn't put the book down.The lead character is beyond resourceful, incredibly intelligent and highly amusing and is backed up by many other equally strong players.The level of detail in the explanations of how the Martian habitations and vehicles work and how the lead character and his compadres on earth cannibalise them to overcome the numerous set backs is quite staggering. The author, I guess, has an intimate knowledge of this arena or has spent countless hours researching it, or maybe just has an incredible imagination! Whatever the reason I have to say massive congratulations to him for an excellent book.It is super techy throughout but even though I couldn't comprehend many of the calculations needed to modify the equipment and so stay alive I wasn't at any time overwhelmed by it.If you are in any way interested in mans struggle against seemingly insurmountable odds, Sci Fi or space exploration read this book, you will not be disappointed.

  This book is simply brilliant. I suppose that when people who work with space missions daily talk avidly about a book together and recommend it to colleagues that is pretty good evidence that it is good. I was recommended this book by my Boss, a Mission Manager for an upcoming Mars mission. We have had a whole series of debates over coffee about this book and its plot.The book starts with a bang. And works up to a climax. It took only a few pages for me to be extremely impressed by the way that the astronaut just happened to know off the top of his head the basic numbers for (and be able to calculate by mental arithmetic from them) all his life-support requirements. It's impressive. Maybe astronauts do - or will - know all this stuff. And he just happened to have the one item in stores that would potentially save his life.For imagination and the remarkable way that the author finds and solves the problems that his fictional astronaut would have to resolve, this book is pretty unbeatable. Everything is explained carefully and sensibly and, remarkably plausibly. Sometimes though a little too plausibly.There were a number of occasions in flight operations when I read something and thought ""but it isn't done that way!"" But I suppose that those are acceptable for dramatic licence. There are also some details of Martian agriculture that I am very dubious about (the soil is full of oxides and superoxides and would act nicely as bleach... not the best medium for cultivation unless neutralised first, but a great way of sterilising human waste). Anyway, that is just quibbling. Avid readers will find one or two more items that they may debate (we argued about the dust storm and the toxicity of raw potatoes, as well as the soil chemistry), but that is part of the attraction of the book: it will make real space buffs debate it and try to find possible errors.Always better a hardcover than a paperback and, although I was a little taken aback by the size of the print (it is enormous), the book is beautifully presented.

  When I first saw the trailer for the film, I had no hesitation in marking it in my diary as one to watch, so you can imagine how excited I was to discover it was based on a book and I one-clicked it with equally little hesitation.I loved it. No, really. There could have been so many things wrong with it, but it was close to being one of the most enjoyable books I've read in the last few years. I can totally understand why they're making it into a movie.The premise is simple - an astronaut is stranded alone on Mars during a dust storm and somehow has to find a way to survive for the length of time it'll take someone on earth to notice he's still alive and send a crew to rescue him.The majority of the story is told in logs recorded by Mark Watney,  the astronaut. If you're a trekkie, you'll have to fight the urge to mentally insert ""Captain's log; stardate..."" at the beginning of every chapter! It's a structure that's really difficult to get right, but Weir manages it with only a couple of minor blips. There's a section about 2 thirds of the way through where he suddenly starts referring to Watney in third person, just for two small sections. It's different enough from the rest of the book that it stands out but it didn't really (to me) serve any purpose. There are short cameos from things that are happening on earth and also from the spaceship with his fellow astronauts in that's on the return flight to earth.The truly staggering thing about this book is that it's rammed full of science and figures and calculations, and yet somehow it all makes perfect sense and isn't in any way boring, even to someone like me who isn't interested in theoretical physics. You become so invested in Watney's survival that you follow his plans and progress with acute attention to detail. You happily roll with him through his potato projections, ninja pirate calculations, hydrazine conversion theories and solar cell transportation because each thing is a building block in his long term survival.The strength of the book is in the main character himself. Watney is surprisingly hilarious. The quips he makes had me laughing out loud a few times and you can clearly see how he tries to keep himself sane. His, at times crude, humour is what makes him so endearing and likeable. He's smart and undeterred by every catastrophe the red planet throws at him, and it throws many. Everything that possibly could go wrong does go wrong and he just buckles down and finds a way to get around it.I could go into how this one man stranded on a distant planet could be a metaphor for humanity, but frankly it's redundant because this book is so enjoyable just as a story that it's worth reading just for that one level.I would happily recommend this to anyone looking for an enjoyable, funny, smart and, above all, original romp of a story. I'm off to look for other books by this author...

  I saw a comment on reddit that summarised this book as being for ""people who saw Apollo 13 and wished the whole movie had been more of the scene where the NASA team struggled to connect two pieces with a boxful of parts"", and that is actually what caught my attention and made me consider reading this book.I bought the book on kindle for android via Amazon, and then noticed the 'whispersync' offer whereby you can buy the audible audio version as a promotional rate too, which ended up being cheaper to purchase the ebook and the audiobook than the audiobook alone, so either the original audiobook was overpriced or this is a total steal. Whispersync is supposed to allow you to swap between reading and listening, with the software automatically starting you again at the correct location. I actually foundmyself captivated by the audiobook and listened to this almost exclusively.The story was fantastic, delving into a level of detail that felt like a realistic and immersive work through of the mechanical, physical and chemical problems that could actually be encountered.It was a very immersive story that strikes a good balance of scientific detail that 'sounds' accurate without requiring a Phd to understand.Gripping and enjoyable.

  Written in part journal-style first person narration, and part third-person – this is the story of a single astronaut's (Mark Watney) attempts to escape Mars having been abandoned and left for dead (accidentally).Overall this is sufficiently thrilling and uplifting that I enjoyed it.The protagonist's journal entries, that make up a large portion of the book, are frequently amusing, occasionally gripping and surprisingly educational.They do however contain an awful lot of technical, scientific jargon and info-dumping – a lot of which I felt very tempted to skip; having finished the book I do feel that had I done so, I would not have lost anything of note – which is a shame. It just gets a bit much a times, when I rather have caught up with the Nasa folks back on Earth or the Hermes crew.The book is peppered with events and written with such guile that it was easy to be gripped and even easier to imagine one's self in Mark Watney's boots – albeit knowing that you'd never cope anywhere near as well. Watney's a clever, practical guy – but he's an astronaut, so his solutions hardly require suspension of disbelief)Good read if a bit too technical for my liking.

  Ho. Ly. Hell.This was such a good book.Let me set a bit of context for you. I not a massive sci-fi fan. I mean, I like a future dystopia or a post-apolcalypse, and I enjoyed The Reality Dysfunction and Asimov and Phillip K Dick and H.G. Wells, and I love Firefly and Serenity and Star Wars (although that’s more science fantasy) and Doctor Who and Back to the Future and Gravity and Alien...So, do you see? I like a bit of sci-fi, but not I’m not all about the hardcore sci-fi.I loved The Martian, though.Like, I loved it.The Martian tells the story of Mark Watney, an astronaut who has been stranded on Mars. I know. Nightmare. Luckily, Mark Watney is a resourceful chap and The Martian charts his desperate struggle for survival as the only human being in a barren, airless desert world with only the crap left behind from previous Mars visits to work with.The Martian is told in a mixture of first-person diary entries and third-person narrative and the contrast works really well. Mark Watney is a lively, engaging protagonist and Andy Weir manages to keep you guessing about his ultimate fate literally until the last few pages. Truly nail-biting stuff. I had about 8% of the book left to go on my Kindle and I took it to the gym with me to read while I was on the cross-trainer, so desperate was I not to put the damn thing down.About halfway through, I was enjoying The Martian so much that I decided to go onto Amazon to see what the negative reviews were saying. Not that I was being a pessimist or anything, I was just wondering what people could find that was wrong with it. The most negative reviews came from people who were saying things like, ‘Well, it’s a bit too sciency for me’. Well, duh. It’s called science fiction. And besides, it’s not really that sciency. The author does explain how the protagonist manages to fix some equipment and create water and so on, but he doesn’t exactly go into pages and pages of textbook detail. I was no fan of chemistry at school, and I was certainly no fan of physics, but I kept up just fine. I would say the science is about as tricky as The Big Bang Theory, and it’s thanks to TBBT that I know what Schrodinger’s Cat and String Theory are.The Martian was originally indie-published and I understand that Andy Weir is now the poster boy for the self-publishing movement. Well done to him. I reserve 10 out of 10 scores for truly remarkable books, and I really feel that The Martian is one of these.

  I got ridiculously emotionally invested in this story, even though I would say I couldn't comprehend about half of what Mark Watney spent the book explaining. Andy Weir is either a genius or a genius at pretending to be a genius. I just nodded and let him take me along for the ride.I knew what the premise of the book was, although the style of narration wasn't what I expected; it was quite sparse in terms of providing a sense of the visual, focusing instead on hard facts, calculations and details of Watney's daily fight for survival. Watney's dry humour does, however, add a healthy colour to the story, and made me snigger more than times that I can count. His POV isn't the only one as it turns out, and it was slightly jarring at first to have spent a while with him, and then suddenly leap back to Earth - but fine, once I got used to it. The one problem is that it's pretty hard to keep up with the names of all the secondary characters, especially when you're trying to concentrate on just understanding the science they're saying.The other problem with this book is that it's extremely difficult to put down. And this is coming from someone who's working on her dissertation and really should not be reading any fiction at the moment. Instead I sacrificed a few nights, gasped a few times, and then put the Apollo 13 soundtrack on for the ending. It was awesome.Bring on the film, I say!

  The story is gripping from the start and remains so right up to the end.I really appreciated the attention to factual detail in this novel and found very few places where I thought the action or scenarios were implausible or incorrect. There actually were a couple, but they weren't serious.This is a very clever book satisfyingly grounded in real science which was used to describe Mars, the spaceships, the missions and more. In particular, sound science was used by our protagonist to solve numerous tricky problems in order to stay alive on Mars under the nightmare scenario of being stranded there, injured and alone in a terrifying and incredibly hostile environment trying to kill him at every turn.Our protagonist's wry sense of humour helped to round off a truly excellent story.This novel is worth an easy 5 stars and I'm looking forward to Andy Weir's second book.

  I read most of this book while laid up in bed on day with a back spasm so I related to what happens to the main character about half way through! This is a book for ""hard"" sci-fi fans. If you get a geeky thrill from the thought that a human being could drive to the old Pathfinder Mars probe and retrieve it, then hack into its radio hardware to communicate with Earth, you'll enjoy this book. It's about as credible as it's possible to be in terms of its detail (although I speak as a humble science graduate, not a NASA engineer) but (perhaps because I was uncomfortable), the endless ""this problem occurred so I did this"" routine went a little stale 75% of the way through and I confess I skimmed just a little.I actually found the sections set on Earth, as NASA attempts to first communicate with him and then work out a way to bring him home, the most interesting. I think it's fair to say the bureaucracy of that venerable, monolithic, organisation does not come out of this smelling of roses.Overall, an engaging read. The prose is sparse and perhaps the most unrealistic part of the whole plot was that the main character seemed to suffer no psychological effects from being alone for so long and the prospect of facing dangerous situations just about every day.

  Well, for a start, this novel is much better than the film, and I thought the film was good.  The story is essentially a first person narrative about Mark Watney, a scientist accidentally marooned on Mars by his colleagues, who thought him dead, after a storm causes them to abandon their base and leave for Earth.  The actual premise is, to be fair, kinda contrived.  But the magic of the story is Watney's humorous day by day diary of his hit and miss attempts to survive on Mars using his scientific skills and pure willpower.  It's a roller coaster ride right until the final sentence.  Most of the scientific explanations Watney gives for his various survival techniques went over my head, but this does not distract from an exciting and very readable story.

  I picked this up a while ago as the concept sounded fun but then I left it a while, thinking it would be a trashy summer holiday hit (it probably will be, once the film is out). Anyway, I had a holiday and something I could pick up and leave easily and gave it a try. It is very much a ""blockbuster"" book but it does a really good job of being easy to follow and damn addictive. I found myself dipping into the book whenever I had some free time available.Think Apollo 13/Robinson Crusoe/Castaway and you'll be close to what ""the martian"" is like.Watney, the protagonist goes from one hopeless situation to another, using his wits to survive just a little big longer. That constant pattern of challenge - solution keeps the book moving at a solid pace throughout. The author doesn't seem afraid to use whatever writing style that's necessary to tell a scene although I did feel it jumped around a bit too much in places and that the first person ""log"" style was the most enjoyable.I've no idea how well the science holds up but it was solid enough to have me not outright calling ""BS"" on it. So it appears to be well-researched (although I probably wouldn't want to know if it isn't, now). It also did a really good job of injecting that sense of wonder and exploration that a sci-fi novel should have in a semi-contemporary setting. Hopefully the book/film will inspire people to try it themselves!

  During a manned mission to Mars, a storm moves across the planet, and the crew of Ares 3 realise that they have to evacuate.  As they head to their ascent vehicle, the storm blows a satellite dish into the path of the explorers, striking Mark Watney and propelling him through the air away from his friends.  His life signs reading zero on their computers, they have no choice but to leave without him.  However, it transpires that Watney is merely injured, and now stranded on Mars, his supplies dwindling and the technology failing around him, and with no means to contact his fellow astronauts or NASA.  Thankfully his background in engineering and botany may just save his life.Although I'm not a fan of sci-fi, ""The Martian"" reads as more of a straight thriller.  Will he survive?  Can he get away from Mars?  The pace is fast, and the complications come relentlessly - no sooner has one catastrophe been averted than another is on the horizon.  The book is written in two styles.  The majority takes the form of Watney's logs from the surface of Mars, and these are written in a breezy, witty, slightly chummy way, full of ""yay!""s and the like, and to be honest his constant optimism does get a little wearing - can nothing phase this guy?  The rest is in the conventional third person style, and these parts concentrate on the people at NASA, and Watney's fellow astronauts.I did find the book enjoyable but personally it felt a little overlong.  As others have commented it's also full of numbers and technical descriptions, so from time to time it feels a bit like a maths puzzle!  The author has clearly done his research though, but it does feel a bit like he felt compelled to cram every bit of it into the book.All in all, it's an enjoyable, undemanding read.

  What an amazing book! One could explain the plot in a sentence, but there is no boredom here! Suspenseful throughout, with numerous ‘puzzles’ to be solved (a bit like a computer adventure game, actually), building to an emotional climax. Some people have complained about the detailed data and calculations but this makes it all so realistic. One might cynically wonder whether, having found out that Watney was still alive, those in authority would have told anyone. But, given that they do here, the way in which the entire world ends up rooting for him is plausibly handled, even though the cost is (appropriately) astronomical.The amount of research that must have gone into the background for the book is awesome. If NASA were planning a manned Mars mission, they would be mad not to invite Andy Weir to act as a consultant. He has already anticipated so many things that might go wrong and worked out how to recover from them. It certainly reads more like science fact than science fiction. And Watney has a wicked sense of humour to break the tension and keep us amused.

  Loved it, can say no more. Ignore the negative reviewers (many of which seem to have a problem with the main character saying things like 'yay me' when he does something well - apparently only 12 year old girls say that which is patently not true). You do care for Mark Whatney and what happens to him and the book is written mostly as a series of logs where Mark discusses his activities for the day and his plans for the following day. At the start you get to read a summary of the main characteristics of the 6 initial astronauts and Mark's is written in the exact style you would expect based on his report, namely humorous and flippant with little regard for authority. Ok you do just have to accept some of the science and data as it does get a bit 'heavy' at times but in no way reduces the enjoyment of the story and I thoroughly enjoyed it. However, if you didn't like my use of the word 'heavy' back there then you may fall into the 'yay me' haters camp so ignore everything I just said as you probably won't even finish it.

  Bought this yesterday evening and have read it cover to cover already! It's been a long time since I read a whole book in two days, but I couldn't put this down! I love sci-fi, and the realistic side of everything in this was so refreshing. If like me, you sat watching ""Gravity"" thinking ""how dumb do Hollywood think we are????"", then you'll love this book. Also, the story's so much better than something like mission to mars or red planet, it's not a plot spoiler to say they don't send a killer dog robot to Mars in this one (and there's no space aliens in the giant face rock thing either.)The writing is very clever, very funny at times, and really makes you wonder what the hell you do with your own time you have.Loved it, highly recommend it to anyone and can't wait for the film to come out (please don't be as bad as Prometheus!!!)I may be biased a little as I'm reading this book in a hotel room while working 2000 miles from home in a hot country I don't want to go outside in :-)

  Aside from the first dust storm which is pure fiction - because of the very thin atmosphere, a 100 mph wind on Mars would equate to an 11 mph wind on earth in destructive force - the science is really very good. To some extent, it lightly relies upon a few advances in our capabilities, but generally the engineering isn't stretched to anywhere near breaking point. In particular, the orbital mechanics are flawlessly worked out and just as much a frustrating bind as they would be in real life.Setting aside the science, it's a rattling good yarn and you really do need to turn the page to follow the adventures of the loneliest man to have ever existed (sic!). Have no fear, it isn't all hyp, it really is a good story. Go buy it!

  I enjoyed the survival spirit aspect of the story (even if a bit far fetched), and there was some humour in there that made me laugh at times.  Unfortunately, about a third way into the book, the amount of 'science', numbers, and smartass one liners became very repetitive and boring, and I lost interest in whether any of the characters lived or died.  I should say I usually enjoy numbers and science if interwoven into a story line without completely overwhelming it,  but this was not the case here.

  Andy Weir had me at the first sentence of the mind-bogglingly fabulous novel that is The Martian. Mark Watney is an astronaut who gets accidentally left for dead during an aborted mission on Mars. Trouble is, he ain’t. Dead, that is. On the other hand, he’s now stuck on a planet determined to kill him properly this time. What follows is a breath-taking adventure filled with brilliant science (really, Mark Watney is one smart dude, which means by default Andy Weir is either a frickin’ genius or has some NASA employees tied up in his basement), disco, things blowing up (Boo!), things not blowing up (Yay!…not my words, it’s what Watney says when things go wrong/right on Mars…), more disco, Aquaman, and a jaw-dropping rescue mission that has the entire Earth rooting for a single man’s survival. If you don’t fall love with Mark Watney in the first few pages of the book, then, er, read on. He’ll grow on you. Andy Weir is now on my list of “must-read” authors.

  Every once in a while you come across a truly phenomenal book. It happened when I read the Kingkiller Chronicles , It happened when I read the Demonata Saga and by god it has happened again. This is one of the best books I have ever read. Not only that, it is one of the few books which I feel it NEEDS to be made into a film(which I believe it is). This book has the perfect combination of thrilling moments combined with perfect amounts of hilarious comic relief, because without that this would be a very dark book. The majority of the story is told through reading various ""Logs"" recorded during his experiences on Mars. At first I felt this would be off putting but it works PERFECTLY. Just give this book a go and I guarantee you will enjoy it. It is not a difficult read so do not fear you will find it this, but the story is enthralling and had me reading it from the second it arrived and I struggled to put it down to eat and drink when I got it. It was the first book in a long time that has had me up till 3 in the morning just reading, constantly wanting to know what will happen next.

  Mark Watney is a man on a mission to Mars. He’s by no means the first person to set foot on the Red Planet, but he was supposed to be the last, as part of a group of astronauts, to leave it. After a storm separates him from his group, they presume him dead and head for home. But Watney isn’t dead, and he only has enough food for 300 days, which he must spend in a habitat designed to last 31 days, until a possible rescue, in more than four years. So yeah. He’s screwed.Andy Weir’s The Martian sees Watney stranded on Mars with nothing but NASA’s greatest minds and his own botany and engineering skills to keep him alive until the next mission to the Red Planet arrives. The sheer direness of his situation throws the story forward, but it’s Watney’s sense of humour that characterises the science (“There, I saved myself 3.6 pirate-ninjas.”) and moves it above and beyond the monotonous realism of the likes Robin Crusoe, which is a natural comparison. Watney’s log entries, which largely tell the story, are a joy to read, because no matter how dire his situation becomes, he cracks jokes in the face of mortal danger like John McClane laughs off the threats of sharply dressed German terrorists and collapsing buildings. Yippee-ki-yay indeed.Interestingly, man setting foot on Mars is that next big step in space exploration that feels possible. Weir does not have to dash far into the future to make The Martian a possibility, and this almost-realism beckons comparisons with Robinson Crusoe, or any other story that pits one man against impossible odds, like I Am Legend. But where others trip up is in the dreary and depressing execution, the inevitability of a defeated ending. One man cannot make a difference. But in The Martian, Weir goes in the other way, and well.He does a superb job of rousing support for the underdog, because the reader really wants Watney to survive. When he finally manages to contact NASA, the whole world hears about his situation and rallies to support a rescue mission. The thought that one man is alone on an entire planet 10s of thousands of miles away strikes an uncomfortably lonely chord among humanity, and the reader is not immune, which makes the payoff all the more satisfying (“‘Iron Man, Commander. Iron Man.’”).The Martian’s tension is its most surprising trait. Weir crafts the tension and pace so well that it is easy to forgo sleep for one more chapter. A novel about Mars, the science of creating a potato garden on a planet with no atmosphere, and disco music, should be terrible, but it’s far from it. The Martian is spectacularly funny and nerve-wracking, and not to be missed.

  I really, really enjoyed this book. I hope they do it justice when the Film comes out.I fully expected this to be a boring narration of one mans depressing time stranded on an alien planet. I was sure it would be full of morose soliloquies and fantastical, unrealistic imaginings of how he survives and, eventually, gets himself home.Instead, I got Mark Watney. Mark Watney is my Hero.descriptionThe book is split between Mark's logs and a narrative of what is happening back on Earth. Normally, I tend to favour one POV over the other when this is the case, but not this time. I enjoyed both POVs equally and loved every character that came along, even those who only made a pit-stop appearance. Particularly Mark's Ares 3 crew-mates. Martinez, you're the man!Mark's personality is wonderful, and I don't think this book could have worked as well as it did if Mark had been any other kind of person. He's optimistic, intelligent, realistic, brave, incredibly funny and very much all-or-nothing. Mark's can-do attitude and restless need to do everything he can to save himself really keeps you rooting for him through-out the book. You can't help but like Mark Watney.descriptionThe story itself is great; its the story of how one mans plight manages to bring an entire world together to try to get him home. It's heart-warming. It's how you hope the world would react to a situation like this. It's how you want the world to react to every situation.It's a very technical story. There is a lot of science in this book - funnily enough, that's probably why it comes under Science Fiction. A lot of the science went completely over my head, and it did eventually come to the point that as soon as I realised that I wasn't going to understand whatever it was that Mark was trying to explain, I started to skim read until we got back to more comfortable ground for me - this is where the book loses a star, as far as I'm concerned. But there was actually so much to learn in this book.descriptionIt turns out that there is a hell of a lot about this book that is technically accurate, as far as it can be. I cannot even begin to imagine the amount of research that must have gone into this book. Andy Weir, you are a trooper.This book had me smiling and laughing and frustrated and gripping the edge of my kindle in suspense. It had it all.But the thing that really makes this book? The humour. Oh God, the humour is incredible ...""[11:49] JPL: What we can see of your planned cut looks good. We’re assuming the other side is identical.

  This is a fantastic read, in fact I'd go so far as to say it's some of the best sci-fi I've read recently. Normally I like my science-fiction to be about big ideas, here we have a more personal drama with a lone astronaut stranded on Mars after he is presumed dead in an accident. He then has to try and survive as best he can.It's an enthralling tale, I particularly enjoyed how he solves the problems he comes up against. It does get a little technical at times, although it is written in a way that makes the more technical aspects comprehensible. There's clearly been a lot of research into the book and that shows, it has an authentic feel to it.More importantly the story is well written and there's some excellent humour. The main character is a joy to follow and I connected with his story. The only off moment I had with the book was a slightly preachy section right at the end. In fairness that's probably just me :-) If you like science fiction, or a good survival story then this is definitely worth a read.

  I've been looking for a refreshing book - something that doesn't feel familiar with that sort of ""been there done that"" feeling I get when I first start reading a book, and this was it.The Martian has a gripping plot and it really appealed to the nerd in me with the right level of technical stuff - science, maths and logical reasoning problems - while also not allowing me to get bogged down. Only at a few points I started skim reading over the technical stuff.I have only one criticism, though not enough to drop to 4 stars, which is that I felt Mark is TOO capable and seems to be immune to the psychological trauma that being alone for that long will have on a human. It's get it that he uses lateral thinking and ingenuity, but it just seems too...convenient?Then again if he wasn't capable then the book will be very short. Chapter 1: Mark is stranded. Chapter 2: He's dead.What surprised me was how likeable Mark was and how much I could relate to him. He's quite adaptable, not easily broken and also funny in a witty, sarcastic style.Excellent, excellent read - I'm finding it very hard to find the next book to read now! Hope Andy releases his next one soon.

  Magnificent, intelligent, hard science adventure for kids & grown ups. The maths is mostly pre-GCSE, chemistry is perhaps post-GCSE, but so well done it is probably accessible to an interested 12year old, and rewarding to follow it through at any age, even if only partly grasped.The outline premise is credible and no prizes for saying about near-future Mars astronaughts. Problem solving and positive thinking of the most extreme kind. I won't give plot spoilers, plenty of places you can get those! There is human/ character / psychology aspects, politics and NASA/ team dynamics, physics, chemistry, cosmology, maths and even a bit of geology. Plenty to satisfy the eager reader's brain. A real page turner.I understand the film is a barer version (can't wait all the same) and so the book will always have pride of  place in such a technical tale. This has been the most grabbing and real of all the recent great fiction I've read: Solo-derring-do against the hard facts of physical limitations/ laws, really believable extreme adventure/ escape/ survive/ fixit-right-first-time-or-die stuff.  McGyver eat you heart out, this is how the best of the right stuff ought to be. Then in a bit less detail, the team excellence to back up the man at the tip of the pyramid.This will be a classic, all-time great, desert island keeper

  A fantastic novel about a subject that is becoming ever more present in our day to day lives. The language used in The Martian - though focused on space-related terms - is remarkably simple to understand: I felt that I learnt so much about science (not just in relation to space travel and maintenance) and as the majority of the book is told in a factual style, you do feel as though you're gleaning knowledge from a subject that isn't as interesting without the story.That being said, Mark Watney is extremely likeable, real and level-headed - all characteristics which translate perfectly as the bulk of the novel is told in first person. I felt this was a perfectly realistic story of something which is yet to become real. An absolute page turner that had me laughing out loud at several points: a definite read for fans of Interstellar and Gravity.

  Contrary to the usual procedure, I did watch the film first. And I enjoyed it very much and think it's a fine work by it's director, Ridley Scott.When reading the book it's clear it's written like a screenplay. A guide book to filming it. It's all there: the tempo, the drama, the sense of humor, the characters ... and Mars.  And it is precisely how all these elements are developed an intertwined that makes The Martian a very credible story. It has reminded me of the Apollo flights and how the astronauts used their sense of humor in the face of problems and how they used their discipline and training to get over them. Just as in The Martian. A very believable story and a recommendable book to read (and re-read) and enjoy doing it.

  A surprisingly good book, especially considering the price bracket.  It probably won't interest the diehard space opera fans as it lacks super-villains and battle cruisers, but the diary of the stranded astronaut, everyman Mark Watney surprised me by being upbeat, profane and funny and drew me in so that I was really rooting for him.  If you liked the film Apollo 13, you might like this.If you object to detail, or prefer symbiotic aliens, or don't warm to Watney, then you will struggle with this book.  As the majority of readers won't be astronauts, engineers, or botanists, there is a certain amount of explaining stuff to the layman.  I could see how some might consider that tedious but I certainly didn't find it so.Other reviewers have noted the frequent use of swear words. The swearing doesn't bother me but it might bother you.  Contrary to what some people seem to think, profanity is common, even amongst highly trained professionals.I too noticed the arguably unlikely lack of depression.  The psychology is a moot point; most of us would struggle with such isolation but I am willing to accept the hand picked, highly motivated member of an extremely testing interplanetary mission might be different.  If you want to read an actual example of one man's response to total isolation, you could do worse than ""A world of my Own"" by Robin Knox Johnston, a man who spent many months alone on his tiny boat during his record round the world voyage in the days of stiff upper lips.

  There have been a lot of books dealing with the topic of astronauts stranded on Mars, but Andy Weir's The Martian is, in my opinion, one of the better ones out there.Where this book stands out from all those other stories about Mars is the details. In simple terms this really is nothing more than a kind of retelling of Robinson Crusoe on Mars, with elements of Gravity thrown in for fun.The main bulk of the story is told through the log entries of the main character, astronaut Mark Watney, as he struggles to survive alone on Mars after being left behind by his crew mates. In fact we don't get to meet any other characters until we're several chapters in, when the focus switches to the NASA team back on Earth who learn that Watney's still alive and go all out to find a way to get him home.Watney himself is a very well written character; an expert botanist and engineer (skills which serve him well in his quest to survive), he is also one hell of a smart-ass with a slightly dark and twisted sense of humour. Indeed, if the entire novel consisted of just his log entries I think it would still be a lot of fun to read, though the use of alternative viewpoints throughout does give the narrative a lot more depth than it would have with just a single narrator.It's pretty obvious from the word go that Weir has done his homework on this novel. The science here isn't technobabble, but real-world hard science and the technology appears to be based as closely as possible on existing or realistically achievable space tech. The author makes it clear that he knows what he's talking about and doesn't skimp on his role as an educator as well as an entertainer. Perhaps I've spent too long reading the more fantastical sort of sci-fi but I found the hard science in this one to be refreshing.The history of the book itself is also worth commenting on. It was originally released as a free serial on Weir's own website after being rejected by various literary agents, and then later self-published through Kindle Direct at the request of the author's fans. From there it managed to generate enough interest for the publishers to take notice and since then it's proved to be something of a runaway hit, with a movie of the book due out later this year. If the film stays true to the book then I'm really looking forward to seeing it, despite Matt Damon having the starring role.So in conclusion, I personally think this is a great book and heartily recommend it to anyone who fancies a bit of sci-fi that relies on reality more than fantasy, but still wants a corking good read to keep them going. I wouldn't quite give it five stars (I am quite sparing with those five-star reviews), but would give it four-and-a-half if I could.

  As I'm a sci-fi adict I mostly liked this book but I can see where those who scored it one star are coming from. And, just for comments sake, this isn't 'Gravity meets Robinson Crusoe ' as stated on the cover, it's Apollo 13 meets McGuyver!Good stuff : excellant description of Mars technology and nerd working, keeps you tense for most of the book, as time ticks away and problems occur and its feels mostly workable.  Once you get into the book you won't be able to stop and it is a good light read.Bad stuff: the first 52 pages bury you in calculations about air and spuds which is not a good start at the start.  I almost gave up but once NASA realises that our hero is alive its gets much, much, better.  I'd agree that some of the vocabulary is just plain wrong for an astronaut but this is just about excusable and does add some humour.  My worst complaint is that Andy Weir MUST get a better editor - I started counting the use of 'got' in its various forms over the first few pages and then stopped as I was destroying my interest... But really so many!  You haven't got to use it all ..its just lazy.

  An excellent story that shows you just how ingenious humankind can be. Stranded botanist Mark Watney uses everything at his disposal to survive on Mars, and it's testament to the detailed research Andy Weir must have done when writing the story. Everything that happens, could - theoretically - be possible. Watney is a likeable hero, who maintains his optimism in the face of crisis after crisis. A man with the Right Stuff indeed, as an astronaut shoud be.The only reason I've not given it five stars is the author's tendency to go into a great deal of technical detail about exactly how many litres of hydrazine can produce how many kilograms of hydrogen, exactly how much water potatoes require to grow, how many amps a remote rover runs on, and so on. I appreciate the detail but after a while I did find myself beginning to glaze over at yet more calculations being done by Mark Watney on the page in front of me. Unlike a maths exam, you don't always need to show your working, and I'd have been happy just to accept some facts as a given. But it's a minor niggle in a story that keeps the suspense up and constantly brings new surprises.

  A great book detailing the trials and tribulations of a lone astronaut trapped on Mars and his attempts to survive and perhaps, maybe, one day return to Earth. Currently being adapted as a film by director Ridley Scott and starring, amongst others, Matt Damon and Sean Bean.I found the novel itself well written and engaging from the very start. I did begin to lose a little interest in the first couple of chapters as there is a lot of scientific and mathematical exposition, however STAY reading and don't put it down - once you get to the next few chapters the book goes from interesting to absolutely riveting. Any concerns I had about the technical explanations detracting from the story dropped away.I'm not a mathematician or botanist so I don't know how accurate all the science is in the book but it certainly makes for a believable scenario and achieves the desired effect. The dialogue is snappy with some great references and the characterisations well written.I was totally invested in the story after a few chapters and read a large portion of the novel in one nail-biting sitting.

  This book's premise sounded pretty uninspiring, but it was late and I couldn't see anything in the Kindle store that looked much better so I gave it a go. I'm so glad I did: it turned out to be not just a 'one man against Mars' space thriller with all the techno-tedium that implies, but a warm, gripping, human story - certainly not short on thrills, but with a great deal more to offer besides. The central character is so real and likable that it's impossible not to care, and even Mars itself develops a kind of fascination that I really hadn't expected. I can't fault the writing, and while I have no way of knowing whether the science is authentic, it certainly sounds authoritative enough to have me convinced. Altogether a good read.

  Totally caught me unawares to be honest. I bought this book having read a couple of reviews but not really expecting much.And I was as wrong as a wrong person can be. It is a book that gripped me from the start to the end of a single session read. Utterly, utterly superb. I read voraciously and I have since I was about 8 years old. All sorts of stuff, from pap to the classics and there are very few books in my 47 years that I have felt so engaged about and so involved. I internally cheered and sobbed as the hero of this story struggled on in a Martian version of Robinson CrusoeThere are no wars, no fighting and no death defying nonsense. Every cliffhanger is plausible. The engineering and science is exceptional and either the writer is a space scientist or engineer or he has an all consuming passion about the subject. I'm not a NASA engineer but I am an electro-mechanical one and I understood the methods and thinking throughout this book and at no point did I think it was impossible. The fact that Andy Weir managed this whilst maintaining a firm grip on the story and character development is nothing less that staggering.The story is simple. Astronaut is left behind on Mars with precious little chance of survival unless he can make a long trip and survive a couple of years. However. Mr. Weir has taken a simple premise and woven a taught, chair gripping and frankly damned exciting book. The lead character is possibly the most heartening literary character that I've come across and to find myself feeling so engaged in his day to day fight for survival left me drained by the end of the book.It is quite simply a modern masterpiece and Mr. Weir deserves huge applause for creating it.

  All the techie stuff amazingly adds to the excitement and tension. Mark Watney is a terrific character - a truly believable all-too human superhero: funny, resourceful, intelligent but down to earth (can totally see why they've cast Matt Damon as him in the movie version).The interplay between what Mark is going through on Mars and what both the NASA folks back on earth and his fellow crew mates on board Hermes are feeling is well handled. Although personally I couldn't wait until we got back to Mark and his brilliant logs.The final few pages are genuinely suspenseful and it's been a long time since I read anything that actually made me hold my breath - a testament to how much I had invested in the characters by that point.

  I'm usually not a huge fan of Sci-Fi: I prefer to read Epic/Dark Fantasy or sometimes Historical Fiction. But when I saw the cover (not the Matt Damon one - the original) and the title of this book, I knew I would have to purchase it.First and foremost: it's funny - no, hilarious actually. The way in which Astronaut Mark Watney describes his seemingly hopeless circumstances had me howling with laughter through half the book. His sense of humour is a bizarre mix of cynical/sarcastic and surprisingly optimistic and it really makes the book.Those with scientific minds will love this one: it's chock full of problem solving! one disaster after another strikes, and it is genuinely a delight to watch Watney struggle to survive with such limited resources.My main problem is characterisation: there is no significant character development and we never really learn much about any of them. However, this is hardly the book's fault, as it was never intended to be written this way. It's merely my preference (being a Fantasy Fan). It certainly should not stop you from reading, as this is a fantastic piece of entertainment. Mark Watney is a true Martian.

  Definitely one of my all time favourite reads! I didn't know what to expect from this book when I first picked it up, but when I started it I was instantly hooked. The main character is one you will like and root for the very moment you start the first chapter. He'll make you laugh while things are going very badly wrong around him. A couple of times I felt my heart pounding at the anticipation of what would happen next.I absolutely loved all of the scientific stuff in this book as well, it makes you really believe the main character is there and thinking through his options. It's a story of survival and will, against all odds, against a seemingly hopeless situation.You will not regret reading this story, it is something very special. Think apollo 13 for tension levels.Now it's being made into a film too! I think I might burst with excitement!!!

  Mark Watney is abandoned on Mars as his crew-mates, caught in a sandstorm, believe him dead and have to leave to save themselves.  There is a follow up mission to come, and Watney has shelter and oxygen. Unfortunately what he doesn't have is sufficient food or water, and the radio back to earth was destroyed in the sandstorm. Also the next landing site is several thousand kilometres away.What follows is a tale of one man's attempt to survive using his ingenuity to jerry-rig the available technology to feed and water himself and to overcome the inevitable setbacks he faces. As it progresses the story expands to include both mission control and his fellow astronauts as they return to earth, but I have to say that every time the story left the Red Planet, I found myself waiting to return to Watney telling his tale in the first person through his daily log. I enjoyed this as a story telling device, as one day he sets out his plans (which are often likely to kill him), and then there is a hiatus before he gives his account of the results.This is definitely hard technological fiction. There are no bug eyed space aliens, or faster than light travel. There is just one man, attempting to keep alive using highly recognisable near future technology.  I've read far too much sci-fi than is strictly healthy, but this book does have something original. If anything it is closest in tone to the early parts of Kim Stanley Robinson's Mars trilogy, or even Arthur C Clarke's Fall of Moondust.Weaknesses could be the depth of technical detail (and I'd be interested to re-read it and think about how credible the science is) and the slightly sketchy nature of some of the characters in the supporting cast.However, Weir maintains a cracking pace for his narrative, and where his book really scores is in his central character. Watney is an engaging and highly entertaining narrator, and his comments frequently generate snorts of amusement. Also, through the originality of the story, Weir is able to generate a real sense of jeopardy. One quickly finds oneself rooting for Watney and his crew-mates, but there is always a sense that everyone, including Watney may not make it out alive.This is original, entertaining and sometimes quite gripping. So, unless you are put off by the technical detail (or possibly the frequent,  but highly credible swearing), I can definitely recommend it.

  I really enjoyed reading this book. The author avoids any sci-fi feel quite adeptly, describing futuristic technology in scientific terms that are completely plausible. Only a couple of times did I find the science at all far-fetched, and I felt quite able to forgive those slips.The writing style is enjoyable, but I felt it was slightly sloppy. Or charming; it's hard to say. The perspective switches from first person to third, between characters, and occasionally even to inanimate objects. This doesn't feel too forced, though. I think he gets away with it.The only real negative for me was the very informal tone that is prevelant in dialogue throughout the book. This didn't seem to match what I've previously seen of NASA operations, and didn't quite ring true for me.Overall, this is a thoroughly enjoyable read for anyone with even a casual interest in space operations. An interest in science helps a lot, but is not essential to enjoy the book.

  I read a few chapters of my brother's copy during my visit home to Sweden (he reads books in English) and was immediately hooked. For some reason I didn't order it straight away when hot back to the UK but remembered last week.I started reading it as soon as it arrived, stealing time when my boys were having snacks, playing nicely on their own. Who am I kidding, I didn't tidy up or clean for the rest of that day, told my husband to spend quality time with his sons as I ran up to our bedroom for some peace and quiet. I think I might have thrown in a ""headache"" as well.The book is brilliantly written, great character(s) and even though I didn't quite understand all the technical stuff going on, I loved every detail of the descriptions. I also think that as a Mars exploration doesn't seem too far away, it plays with your mind as if the story is something that has actually happened. It really feels like it could be a ""based on a true story"" kind of book but perhaps that's due to my lack of knowledge in technology, space travels etc. It does not really matter to me as I thoroughly enjoyed reading it and finished it within 24 hours.I have booked babysitter to make sure I can go see the movie when it comes out though not in 3D..

  I was drawn to the book by a piece in a recent Saturday ""Telegraph Magazine"". When it said that it had been an Amazon best seller for 99p that tweaked my financial interests and I just thought I may take a look on the Kindle. Well it was up to £3.66, but I still took the plunge.Let me say straight away I don't begrudge Andy Weir a single penny. It is a breathtaking read from start to finish, so much so I've booked the cinema tickets for next week. He writes in a style you don't often see with all the detail required to make Mark Watney come alive. Invariably in this sort of book there would be the soul searching and back catalogue of information of what makes the protagonist tick. But Andy Weir has done a cracking job of focusing on the talents and thought processes needed to stay alive 223 million miles from Earth. I could ramble on, but it's a cracking book, truly unput down able as the say (but Apple refuses to type...). I recommend it at any price - Phil B

  So Mark Watson is sitting on Mars with no food, water etc. How is he going to maintain the air? Where will his food come from? How will he get home? Poor Mark keeps solving his problems using maths, science and ingenuity, but then more problems crop up (an explosion, broken communications, endless disco music) which he solves, apart from the disco. Meanwhile on Earth and in space, lots of people are working out how to get him back. It's an entertaining read, Mark is an immensely sympathetic hero with a wry sense of humour, a lack of respect for bureaucrats and a lot of loyalty to his crewmates. The only problem I had was that I felt more and more inadequate the more I read. If it had been me stuck on Mars, I would have been dead by day 2. I won't spoil the ending but Mark lives longer than this!

  Lovely story telling with huge heart and so much black humour.  Written I am sure by an American but with a real sense of British disdain and sarcasm.  The hero is a wonderful geek with a huge grasp of what is possible and how to survive another day.  For anyone who thinks they can fix pretty much anything then read this book and realise that perhaps there are people out there who are better at it!  Made me remember when I was in my teens and my Dad was watching every minute of the moon landings and when Apollo 13 went wrong. Much though I think America has lost its moral compass, my Dad said at the time ""only American hope and thought could have got the Apollo 13 home"".  I loved the book and the characterisation of the guy left behind was first class.  This is not sci-fi, this is technology of today and blends Robinson Crusoe with the Apollos.  Likeable hero with an unlikely ability to look on the bright side!

  Put simply, ‘The Martian’ is the best science fiction I've read in years. Right from the start, it grabs you in its vice like grip and never lets go until the final page. All the science and space hardware is spot on, nothing has been invented of even exaggerated just for convenience of the story - Andy Weir must have done one hell of a lot of research into this book. Mark Watney is an excellent character, being resourceful, intelligent, witty and utterly human, and you simply can't help but root for him. The story is briskly paced, and life threatening situations pile on top of life threatening situations in an endless assault on the reader - it is simply astounding how so many things can go so wrong to the same person, whilst still remaining utterly believable. Imagine Apollo 13 on steroids and you will get close to the spirit of the book. And whilst on the subject, it would make a cracking movie..... Ron Howard, fancy a crack at this one?So to sum up, I simply can't recommend this book highly enough for sci-fi aficionados and I look forward to reading more from Andy Weir. Well done Andy, more like this please….R.E.Weber, author of The Star Agency. [...]

  A book with a simple premise - NASA's 3rd trip to Mars is cut short when a raging dust storm threatens the lives of the astronauts on the surface. One of them, Mark Watney, is hurt and presumed lost during the chaos of the escape. Injured and alone, Mark must now figure out how to survive and determine if rescue is even a possibility...This is how you write entertainment - It's witty, emotionally engaging, realistic and flowing. Exactly what I want from a book. Written (mainly) in the first person, it pulled me in from the first page and kept me wanting to see what happened. Some interesting narrative tricks about a third of the way through mixed it up enough to keep the format and story fresh.This is how you create a character who you root for - Mark Watney is someone who you feel for every time the universe (well, the author really) throws adversity right at them, grinds it in their face and probably whacks them round the ears just to be sure. The way he deals with it, the way he is impacted by his experiences, is balanced brilliantly. Whether it be the frustration at the planet itself, his anger with his own actions when he causes problems, or how he handles the abundance of disco left behind by his crewmates - It's all handled deftly and with a sense of realism and humour that only real life contains.This is how you make the reader feel emotion - long time since I've welled up at a book. I did with this one. Call me soppy.This is how you sneak some hardcore mathematics, physics and botany into a book without the reader noticing - OK, that's not quite true, you do notice. You notice the regular calculations regarding oxygen levels and water levels and hydrogen levels and potato levels (yes, potatoes feature a surprising amount); but the writing is so absorbing you don't care. You trust they are right and cheer with Mark when he figures it out.This is how you make the reader laugh - I was amazed at how funny I found the book; proper laugh out loud funny. Normally I hate that phrase when it's stated in review (for me it always seems to be a missing factor in the books that claim it), but the humour in this appealed to me immensely. At various times I got strange looks from those around me as I chuckled. At least this time I knew what the strange looks were for.Is it that good? I did find myself waiting for the next problem (and the inevitable solution) to appear, but this was really well balanced by the fact that there are a few red herrings sown into the story so you are never quite sure what action will work. Also, to be fair I did find myself skipping over some of the science bits. Not huge chunks, just scrolling down the sentences to get to the point where Mark said whatever hair-brained scheme he'd come up with would work or why it wouldn't.In summary - I didn't know what to expect from this author (and the fact that this is his first book with no publisher behind it is astonishing - he has just recently sold the film rights though), but I can't recommend it enough. The story is straight forward, but the journey and the characters are what make this a stand out.It's also worth checking out Andy Weirs blog. Some great short and serialised stories on there. The Egg is especially good, although be warned, some of the serials have not been updated for a couple of months.So, go spend the 77p and read it - I promise you, you will never feel the same about potatoes and disco again (seriously, if that line doesn't make you want to go and read a book about a stranded astronaut on Mars then you're dead inside).

  I absolutely loved this book. Captured me right from the start and kept me until the very end. What a journey. I finished this book in a few days, none of it felt like a chore to read. Granted, some of the writing is a bit complex regarding oxygen levels, atmosphere readings, navigation etc. but for me this just added to the overall experience. I wouldnt consider myself interested in space or the planets but I found this book truly captivating and interesting. I loved all the scienctific details about Mars and Nasa in general, not only was the story driven along at a nail-biting pace, but I was learning something new and interesting as well. I was sad when the book finished, I wanted to know more about the protagonist and stay with him longer than the length of the book as he is such an interesting and funny character. I would love to have Mark Watney as a friend!

  When a manned mission to Mars goes wrong and one of their team gets hit they leave him behind when everything points to him being dead. But Mark Watney didn't die and The Martian by Andy Weir tells his story of surviving on a planet where he is the only thing alive.I found this book to be really well done. Its full of technical science that somehow Weir manages to not let the reader get overwhelmed by and that is partly by the style that the books is written with Mark Watney telling the story in audio diaries. Watney is funny and very down-to-earth (Mars?) While still showing the sort of knowledge that being a NASA astronaut takes. You believe everything he says and you become so involved in his story, his constant battle to simply stay alive on a desolate planet. You want him to succeed and are on tenterhooks every step of the way.Occasionally the books deviated from Watney's diary entries to show the team at NASA back on Earth and their efforts to get him back but these segment don't bog things down too much. It really is Watney that will keep you hooked.Don't read  it expecting aliens or any other typical science fiction element but do expect to be thrilled every minute of the journey.

  Cleverly written and somehow managing to cram in just enough science to keep geeks like me happy, but not too much to bore those who just want a good read.The Robinson Crusoe in space theme has been tried before, but never with such great effect. The manner in which Weir has our hero fighting with every fibre of his body and brain cells to survive is exemplary. The challenges he faces and the solutions he finds are surprisingly believable and brilliant. I found myself almost cheering as yet another calamity was overcome by sheer genius ... and sometimes by hellishly unpleasant means. I won't waste it for you by describing our hero's greatest escape feat. Let's just say you'll never look at potatoes the same way again!.I guess the only reason I didn't give this five stars - and it was a close call - was that I wasn't as convinced by the rescue section of the narrative as I was blown away by the astronaut stuck on Mars element. That said I couldn't stop turning the pages so maybe I'm being a bit harsh.I would definitely recommend it, particularly as a holiday read, as you'll be reluctant to put it down after you've read the first, stunningly energetic and gripping pages.

  Not quite the book that an experienced author would have produced, I think.  I felt that it lacked the padding out of the story present in modern stories.  More a book written by an engineer with a sense of humour rather than a writer having to look up technical stuff as they wrote.  I didn't want much more padding, not a thousand page tome, but a better balance of the technical details vs humanity.  I'm an engineer myself, the details were impressive, but not everybody will be of a like mind, they'll want more of the human side of it (that exists, I just mean more of it).It felt very direct, a bit sparse in storyline and grin inducingly witty at multiple points in the story...definitely recommended for the techie minded males out there, though others might well enjoy it very much as well.  It kind of reminds me of some of the engineers turned writers of decades ago...that is definitely not a criticism.  If any names sprang to mind, I'd give them, but they elude me for now.I very much liked it and will be reading anything else of his that I can find in the future, I just think that he's going to get better and better as he goes.  This was a very good start that I didn't hesitate to buy after I reached the end of the free sample.

  A story written with a deliciously new angle.  INSIDE the head, of a man talking to himself as there's no one else at all there to talk to.  A resourceful man who has abilities we all share but seldom use. He has to use his... and the way it is told is so convincing.  The start seems slow and a bit....erm... boring ? as he explains how and what he is having to mend, create, build out of technical bits  but then he draws you in to share his life... and the excitement when Something Is Achieved is shared by the reader.  A perfectly splendid book, especially as it is his first. I hope he can write some more with this very pleasantly different POV. Thank you Andy Weir.

  I loved this book, the style of writing is very engaging and for me as a science geek I loved all the details of the science. I couldn't put it down and read it in two sessions ( would have been one if I had a duvet day!). We read this for a book club book and we had mixed responses. Half of us loved  it and half didn't finish so I guess it is a Marmite book... you love it or hate it. Some felt bogged down by the science whilst others appreciated the thought processes behind the problem solving even if they didn't understand the science. I personally hate books where the character just sits back and accepts what is happening to them  or what has been dealt them this is a great book if you love to see some one fight against the odds by using their brain and ingenuity.I would highly recommend reading the book even if you are intending to watch the film as it provides much more context to his problem solving ability.Andy Weir must have a great knowledge of both Science and the workings of space agencies to create this masterpiece.

  I began this book thinking it would be a bit too technical for me (being a female and all that!) but I so got into the storyline and enjoyed every single minute of the book.  I just couldn't wait to read it every day.  The writing was very descriptive and I could visualise every scene without difficulty.  Obviously many of the technical details were a bit over my head but since it is science fiction and the situations are totally unproven and the result of the absolutely wonderful imagination of the author, none of that actually matters but it was very interesting and I kept waiting to see how he solved his next 'situation'.I have recommended this to my husband to read as we do have similar taste in literature and hope he will enjoy it as much as I did.My only critisism is that the ending seemed a bit rushed.  After spending all those months on Mars and going through all his trials and tribulations, once he got to the shuttle to go home, it seemed to miss out a huge chunk as next page he was back on earth being extremely rude to a small boy!  Nevertheless, an excellent read.

The only reason i didn't give it the 5 stars was i lost it during some science explanations ,but that was only a minor flaw and shouldn't put anybody off as it doesn't affect the enjoyment of the story.

  I have seen the film 6 times, and wanted to experience it's written counterpart.As you can imagine the book goes into greater detail. Some situations are expanded on and some changed. But Ridley Scott captured the feel of the book perfectly.The main character (Mark Watney) is in my opinion a well written and likeable character, smart and capable yet funny and humble. Yet even astronauts are susceptible to bad luck and occasionally human error.Even though this is a piece of fiction, it helps restore a bit of faith in humanity if only to remind us of real life successful failures like Apollo 13.Give this book a read!

  I decided to read the book after seeing the movie trailer and recommendations from friends. What can I say other than it is excellent. It often takes a while for me to finish a book fitting in 20-30minutes a night a few times a week. The Martian however was finished in a weekend and I was left frustrated I had to sleep and do other things which stopped me from finishing it sooner!Although you can easily guess the ultimate ending the route to that point is turbulent and unpredictable but entirely believable. The level of research that has gone into the book is extraordinary but the key to its success along side the expertly created characters.

  This book is quite unusual, in the way it narrates the story and the level of technical detail it provides for the solutions to the cliff hanger problems. It's a bit like the Sci Fi Dan Brown... but that does make it sound a bit trashy. All I mean is that it's got quite a clear mechanism for providing conflict/tension and it rolls them out chapter by chapter.The character of The Martian is likeable, funny and intelligent. His view/narration is provided via his logs, in contrast with the 3rd person narration that relays the actions of NASA on Earth and the small team of astronauts flying between Mars and Earth.I am normally quite a slow reader but I was half way through this within a day - in part because the conversational style of the log reports makes them very easy to digest and in part because the tension and problem solving mechanism makes for a good page turner.I'd recommend this to anyone that's already into sci fi because it's an interesting addition to the genre. For the less geeky reader, the technical descriptions and back-of-a-napkin math might be a little offputting.

  NASA has set up a chain of expeditions to Mars but very soon after landing the third one is aborted and the scientists have to leave. Unknown to them their dead companion, who is not actually dead, finds himself stranded on Mars with little hope of surviving until the next scheduled mission. Air and water are not the problem but he does not have enough food despite being left with the resources to accommodate six explorers.Right from the start this is a gripping page-turner and no matter how hard Mark Watney strives to survive Mars works just as hard to kill him. All the time I was willing him to succeed only to have yet another believable crisis threatening his continued existence. In my opinion you will not find a better thriller set on Mars or elsewhere. I had not previously heard of the author and cannot remember how I ended up buying his book to read on my Ipad, but it was a good day.

  A great book - I knew it was going to be right up my street when I read the first few pages (2%).  The protagonist is instantly likeable and the book has drama, humour and adventure all mixed in catering for all tastes.  If anyone is worried that Sci-Fi is not their thing this book focuses more on the human struggle and problem solving abilities of the main character without drawing to much attention to its future setting (it is also close enough in the future to imagine that it could happen).  The one downside is that he faces so many problems and still manages to solve them every time; this charmed life effect slightly spoils the believability that this could happen.

  Before I get on to my opinion of the book, a note to perhaps clarify some of the other reviews, many of which complain of excessive typos. This book was first self-published as an ebook in 2011, and I can only suppose it is that edition that has all the typos. It has since been published commercially, and the current ebook is the product if that, so has been copy edited. I can'tvsay there  are *no* typos, but I didn't notice any.As for the book, I loved it. It does have a level of technical detail that may put some folk off, but it was exactly that which made it a good read for me - too often in othe sf, impotant points are simply glossed over. It is also quite funny in parts, but believably so, with the kind of dark humour people turn to when in danger.Other than that, it kept me reading at times when I really should have been doing real-world stuff; I found it difficult to put down. So full marks from me.

  This gripped me from the beginning: the plot is sound, the events believable ( more or less) and the approach to dealing with problems realistic. Some have said that it reads like a poorly written school textbook-wish mine were as good when I was at school.Character development is minimal and  insights into philosophy of existence are non-existent. However it doesn't try to fill that market. It tells the story of a man accidentally  left alive and alone on Mars and how he fights for his life and to rejoin the rest of the human race. After finishing it I handed it to my 14 year old boy who enjoyed it as much as I did. If you like the first 2 pages then buy it!

  This book, like the film, may not be to everyone's taste.  I like SF, and I loved the film, but thought the book better because it has so much more detail that could not possibly have been include in the film due to time constraints.  The book has a sense of humour that is missing from the film.Better still, the plot sticks pretty firmly to established science. My one doubt (SPOLIER COMING UP) is whether you could really mix Martian soil, faeces, and water to make a growing medium.  I seem to recollect that a Viking mission added water to Martian soil releasing oxygen.  At first it was thought this was a sign of life, but further consideraton suggested that water was reacting chemically with the soil.  Forgive this blip, and you have a gripping story that could plausibly be set not too far in the future.

  I was awake at 7.30 yesterday and got out of bed at 1.30. The reason?  The Martian!  It was so enthralling that I just HAD to get to the end to find out whether Mark got back home or not. The book is (as other readers have mentioned) very technical in places and full of physics and chemistry but don't let that put you off. You really don't need to understand any of that to fully understand and enjoy the book.I was rooting for Mark the entire time and felt I was with him on Mars too!  The book remains addictive all the way through and I think that is because the plot moves quickly and, by nature of its style, you are never certain whether Mark will be rescued or not.  This isn't a predictive read, in fact it's the opposite. You swing from hope to despair and back to hope, time and time again.It's one of the most gripping books I've ever read. I hope Andy Weir is writing more books. He truly hit the jackpot with this one.

  I'm pleased I read this before I saw the movie, because there is a lot more to the book it seems.The author Andy Weir has struck a really perfect balance between a fascinating, extremely readable story filled with realistic, appealing characters, and an enormous wealth of extremely impressive scientific research.The description of ""how tos on Mars"" can be one a little dry in places - but if I had done so much research, I would want to showcase it too. Aside from a couple of longer descriptive pieces, the book is really incredible and difficult to put down.I'd definitely suggest reading this book before seeing the film - the endings are slightly different, and the movie can't convey the intricate detail of the book.

  I saw the film first, not knowing it was a book, and really enjoyed it. The book is equally great - I love the use of logs as Mark's diary, and I loved that he was so human about things that went wrong, things that went right. I liked the scenes from on earth, and the minor characters were filled out really well. There were some scenes that weren't in the film (obviously), and while I appreciate while some of them weren't, I really really loved the bit where Johansson talks to her father, and the bits related to that conversation.Some of the technical stuff was a bit hard to follow )and would have been harder, I suspect, if I hadn't already seen the film and could match it up to what had happened in the equivalent scene) but at the same time, I appreciated that the mechanical terminology was used.All in all, a gripping, easy-to-read book.

  This is a superbly entertaining read, very well written with excellent character development and an absolutely gripping plot line. Its only problem is being labelled as science fiction and therefore limiting its general appeal. Yes, it's set on Mars; yes, there's a fair bit of science and engineering in the story; and yes, there's even the odd space ship - but seriously, this is great fiction in a technical setting - it is not pure science fiction, and should therefore appeal to a far greater audience.I should add a small warning after reading one of the other reviews on this page, this book does contain the odd profanity. This didn't bother me in the slightest - along with the great wit and humour this just made the whole story more real to me, I mean come on, the poor bugger just got left for dead on Mars with no apparent chance of a rescue, even the most stoic of characters is going to swear about that surely?Seriously people, one of the most entertaining reads I've purchased in a good long while, buy it, read it, enjoy!

  I enjoyed the book. However, I did get rather irritated when he kept on going on about toxic levels of CO2. As this book went into a lot of technical detail I did think it was schoolboy basic science that CO2 (carbon dioxide) is virtually inert. It's carbon monoxide,(CO) that is very toxic. It was strange when at one time it was mentioned that there is virtually no atmosphere but then there was sufficient to blow a satellite dish a considerable distance. I also thought the radiation issues were not addressed. There is also a bit of an issue with the proofreading.

  I liked the book from the start. Less technically-minded might not like detailed technical descriptions of events taking place, but to me this brought back the spirit of Julius Verne. Fitting into current state of science, technology and society, with plenty of details provided and made very believable. Not all of them though: chemical reactions involving hydrazine performed in spartan conditions did stretch my credulity a little - but only after I finished reading! This actually brought forward strength of the story and narration, since while reading everything did fit perfectly. On the other hand, habitat unit (""The Hub"") used by astronauts on Mars is based on existing design of pneumatic habitat structure for Mars and is entirely realistic.If there is one nit with this book, it is missing epilogue in both printed and Kindle edition. I know there is one, since it is available in Audible edition. Perhaps after the recording, the author decided that this part is superfluous and took it out?I can't wait for another book by Andy Weir, although I will understand if he needs time to do his research before writing it :) He really is 21st century answer to Verne.

  I was hooked after about 5 minutes of reading, i dont think it had registered a percentage ! and i knew it was a gripping page turner. I have always loved ScI-fI, even more so when the story blends in with reality,  i loved the plot, the main character, the location setting. The technical data and scenario's desribed, give a very real true life ''feel'' to the story, It's the kind of book, that has you visulising what actor's would play what role, i had no problem quickly selecting Richard Dreyfuss as the main man, the narture of his quick wit, and the willingness to accept the terrible situation he finds himself in, and his ability to deal with it, and adapt, as the story develops.I also sent a copy to my wife's kindle, (registered to me !) and found it difficult not to bring her''up to date'' as i was about 25% ahead of her, she, (not really a Sci-Fi fan) loved the story.Altogether, a dont miss story, gripping until the end.

  Oh I loved this. Techy enough to be interesting (I like Stephen Baxter too) but not so much that it goes completely over my head. I liked the up-close and personal style, I like the odd structure - part 1st person diary, part 3rd person narrative, part communications intercepts, part omniscient narrator. Awesome.Now I've always said in book reviews, I don't really care whether something is technical possible or not. In sf, fantasy or any genre of story. What I care about is the author's ability to make me suspend disbelief enough to care. Weir does this in spades. I have no idea how you survive on Mars - how many calories you need, how you regulate air, waste etc. But Weir makes me believe it's possible, makes me care enough for Mark and then throws enough curve-balls to have me biting my nails... For me it's a testament to a writer's skill that he can go on for pages with details about how to grow potatoes on Mars without boring me!I suspect this is a love-hate book, both in content and style. Fortunately I loved it.

  I purchased this on a whim, having seen things about it online, and once it arrived I read it all in a day! It was brilliant, with a good sense of humour and also so much science written into the plot, which I really enjoyed. You really got to know Mark as he went through his journey, which made the stakes much higher. Every time I was sure nothing could go wrong, it did, and every time I was sure that the story would end badly, he managed to save the day with his quick thinking and (often) sheer bravery. I'm definitely hanging onto this book to read over and over again - I've not enjoyed a book as much as this is a long time! Next up I think I'll need to see the film!

  Sometimes you come across books you simply *have* to read - books that you can't in good conscience ignore. For me, ""The Martian"" is such a book.It took me a few chapters to get into the story. I had early worries that Mark's character wouldn't be developed or believable enough, that the scientific jargon would bog things down, that the lack of detailed description would fail to immerse me in the Martian setting. However, I soon became so utterly gripped by the tension and atmosphere of the story that these concerns failed to trouble me.I liked the main character. His attitude to being stranded on Mars was admirable; he kept cheerful and didn't let the hopelessness of his situation grind him down. The story can be viewed as a series of fiendish scientific puzzles that almost always result in near-disaster (but ultimately Mark overcomes these obstacles thanks to his intelligence and ingenuity).It's proper science fiction - not a space opera. The science is absolutely integral to the story and made it all believable.If you like science fiction you absolutely have to read this book.

  I found this story of an astronaut left behind on Mars  gripping although I guess  it will not be to everyone's taste as it contains many pages of closely argued biological and chemical thought on how to communicate with earth, produce food, separate gases etc with minimal equipment in an attempt to survive until a rescue mission can reach him.  He also has to leave the comfort of his hub and travel many hundreds of kilometers in an adapted vehicle to reach the point at which he can meet the rescue team.  Well written and fascinating.

  One thing I need to mention before I rant on about how glorious this book is, I have to thank the sometimes over spamming adverts on YouTube for showing the trailer of this movie. Without that impromptu Google search that followed and a quick scout on Amazon, I would never have discovered this book even existed.Normally, my reading habits rarely take me out of the horror genre (King, Barker etc) but I thought I'd give this a punt on purely nothing else but my fascination with space... And Mars particularly. Now, I'm not a 'binge reader' as most people are fond of promoting. I lead a busy, sometimes hectic life, with barely enough time to find to sleep most nights. So I generally read as and when I can which usually means it can take a month or two to finish a good book. The Martian is an exception to that rule. A bank holiday weekend, and a few hours of reading rapidly descended into a marathon session, sacrificing my well earned sleep just to keep the pace with Mark Watney. I finished in two days!The log type style, the humour even the remarkably scientific accuracy of the whole thing simply astounded me. I was captivated and marooned with the lonliest guy in the solar system!Don't get me wrong, this story may not be everybody. Some of the science-fact parts maybe off putting to some would be readers, but otherwise I would recommend this read to anyone who finds it even remotely  interesting. Watney's humour is brilliant and sharp and believable.It's told primarily from a diary/log first person format, as I mentioned earlier, occasionally flicking back to earth as well as some flash forward/sideways commentary. The authors style in the third person does lack a few of the nuances of the more seasoned writers, but it's easily overlooked when you consider he skilfully maintains the pace of the story.I won't give any sploilers away here. It's not fair to any of you would be buyers. If you're considering getting a copy, just do it. Seriously. Don't wait for the movie.As much as I credited the movie trailer at the start of the review, my only hope is they do it justice. The only way you're going to know that for yourself is to read this first.For me, this is easily the best science fact & fiction novel I have ever read.

  ...but to my mind it’s not a brilliant book. Realistically, not a lot happens. Our hero is stuck on Mars and has to use all his ingenuity to keep going until rescue arrives. Which is fine, except we don’t need to have all the detailed calculations on food supply, oxygen supply, water supply, electricity supply, drilling techniques, how you cut up a canvas tent etc, which to me was tedious. Technically, it may all be correct but the whole scientific spin is overdone. There is no characterisation - as a few others have said, I didn’t develop any empathy with the main character; and his funny lines are not funny. Lines given to Vogel, the German in Hermes, are embarrasingly bad.I don’t understand the rave reviews the book has had.

  When Astronaut Mark Watney is mistakenly left for dead on Mars, little does anyone know how resourceful this man will be in his quest for survival. Watney manages to cope with life threatening disasters again and again, using a combination of mental stamina and scientific DIY know how. But will his luck finally run out on the red planet? The Martian by Andy Weir is a fascinating story filled with science and technical details yet relayed in small easy to consume episodes, while written in a basic almost novice style that feels fresh and simple, unlike the more polished works of say Michael Crichton or Tess Gerritsen. To conclude The Martian is a truly refreshing piece of work that shows just how powerful and remarkable debut books can be.

  It took a while for this book to get over the science tutorial and really engage me with the story.  I admit that for the sake of credibility the science needs a reasonable level of explanation - but as I used to tell my subordinate engineers: ""I'm happy just to hear your results and conclusions - I don't need you to try and teach me how to do the maths myself!""The lead character is portrayed through the, somewhat shallow, medium of his diary.  However, I'm not sure that anyone, even an American, would write, ""Hell yeah I'm a botanist! Fear my botany powers!"" or any of the many similar exclamations that appear in the text.The plot is an intriguing premise - and it was this that sustained my interest in reading book, despite my initial irritation with the style.  By the time I was halfway through, I was well hooked and thoroughly enjoyed seeing how the story played out.

  Decided to get the book before I saw the film, as the plot seemed interesting and not the usual SF death and glory stuff. Yes there is a lot of science/maths problem solving but not being a science major myself (Failed Maths O first time around!) it seemed plausible enough to me. You found yourself rooting for the guy and smiling at his defiance of NASA protocols. Far fetched? Yes of course, but since when did that stop a story being enjoyable?

  It is easy enough to skip the mathematical explainations if it is not your thing! This remains an exciting tale of space exploration, of an astronaut 'finding something to do as he waits to die', as someone put it. There is even some humour. The imagination lies in putting yourself in that situation on some future Mars mission. How would you react? How would you feel? Astronauts are trained for this sort of thing, but space is dangerous and many things can go wrong. Tiny details overlooked can lead to massive disasters. The situations are (mostly) believable and the science is (mostly) accurate, at least as far as my limited knowledge understands it. I decided to read the book before seeing the movie, in case that made a hash of it (it doesn't)

  It took me a little while to get into this because initially it felt like physics homework. The concept was so good, though, that there was no chance that I wouldn’t read on. Once I stopped myself from trying to check the maths and relaxed into the book it was the most wonderful adventure story which made me think of Robinson Crusoe but with no Friday. I enjoyed the little triumphs as they arose; I sweated with him as one more thing went wrong and Mars looked like claiming him. Right to the end, the reader is on edge and rooting for Mark, the lone Martian.If you love a really good adventure story, this is it. If you enjoy science fiction, this undoubtedly is, but its main strength, I felt, was the sheer determination of a man pitting himself against adverse conditions. The ingenuity, the courage, the dry humour, all drew me in and made me read on. A very good story indeed.

  An absolute delight from beginning to end. I thoroughly enjoyed this book and could not stop reading it to find out what happened next. The humour and light hearted ambiance created by the writer allowed you to not fret over his fate but almost accept it. The Martian himself was very human in every aspect of the word but at the same time he was inventive and desperate to survive. Something we can all recognise within ourselves. I personally also loved the technical detail within it and learnt a lot from it. This detail can be ignored if it doesn't interest you, but I found it fascinating. It is a strangely uplifting book.

To me it read like a screenplay for a film that would ultimately be remembered for it's special effects. Too much of it reads like a chemistry text book and the rest of it is just a sequence of events. There seems to be no exploration of the characters, their backgrounds or relationships. The main character never seems to ponder his past much or think about what it will be like if he gets back to earth.

  good book! Not enough? OK. I saw this book after catching a trailer for the upcoming film adaptation starring Matt Damon and thought I'd give it a try. Really enjoyed it! For all you astrophysicists this book is a must, it goes into detail on how he engineered his day to day survival in great detail! But, if you are not a physics fan, don't be put off cause you can gloss over all the terminology and still enjoy the dry wit injected into the story by the use of some great one-liners and some locker room humour. You cant help but root for him and hope for his survival as the character, Mark Watney, is how you hope all astronauts are, heroic! No superheroes here, just grit and determination. Sometimes a few time-slips pass by with little detail but this probably saves the book from becoming too long. The NASA sub plot as they try to deal with ""losing"" an astronaut on Mars works quiet well and doesn't detract from the main story. Thoroughly enjoyable, read it!

However he is not dead and the book tells of what happens to him next.

  It is some time since I have read and enjoyed a Science Fiction book so much.  This was a 99p 'offer' that I decided to try.  WOW !!  After reading the first few lines I was completely hooked.  It is well written with hardly any 'Jargon' to corrupt the enjoyment of the story. Andy Weir is a new author to me but obviously thinks 'outside the box' with regard to plot. I have, over the years read many science fiction books by virtually all the well known published authors but this book leaves them all at the starting gate.  The story keeps you on the edge of your seat continually and is written so you can leave the book at the end of each chapter wondering how on earth the story will be able to continue.  Even to the final page I was spellbound!!I can highly recommend this book even if you have never tried science fiction. . . . .

  I found this unputdownable despite in some ways being quite predictable and derivative. I quite liked how it used simple science to make it feel believable and I did feel like I was on his journey with him, the world building was so well done.This is an example of why a book doesn't have to be incredibly well written to be good and to do well. It's all down to a good plot, and Andy Weir has written a classic show don't tell story. In fact to the point it reads like a film, and will make an excellent one.I really didn't like the end, the last scene was wrong for the character. I doubt they'll have Matt Damon do that scene.

  If you are buying this because you saw the movie and would like it replicated in print I would advise against it.  This is an interesting semi science-based tale of surviving on Mars.  Not an easy read if you have no interest in that type of thing.  If you are, buy it. Most enjoyable.

  The Martian is a real page-turner. I am not sure whether the science is exact -- and there is a lot of science, though not overwhelming -- but it only needs to sound plausible to make the story interesting, which The Martian truly is.At the beginning, the first-person narration lacks credibility because the writing style is unusual for diarists and even bloggers, but as the story unfolds, you forget about it and the narration from other perspectives cuts in at the right moments. You do not really notice the middle because the book is gripping, but the end will have you back on the edge of your seat.

  The story might be set in a near future where NASA is on its 3rd manned mission to Mars, but the conceit of THE MARTIAN is totally relatable and instantly captivating - what would you do if you were stranded on another planet alone somewhere for years, possibly for ever? Much of the fun lies in following lone astronaut Mark Watney as he faces this scenario , with problems  mounting by the minute and every solution he comes up with usually having to be balanced on a razors edge against the likely costs and side effects (such as oxygen vs co2 vs water vs hydrogen  -how much of one can he safely use to make the other). Watney's gallows humour and Macgyver-like abilities make him a likeable POV character, and every challenge makes for engrossing reading as you see how Watney time and again scrabbles together a solution from duct tape, screws and even potatoes, using up precious resources every time. There's a fair amount of technical detail - but that in itself is essential to the drama, as it's only by jury riggin, reusing and maxing out all the resources at his disposal that Watney is going to have a shot at making it home. The author has done his homework on the science side of things, so you'll learn a few things about space travel, physics and the red planet too. A superb ""hard Scifi"" yarn.

  Actually the writing style is 5*, the characters had depth and individuality, so 5* for that, and the plot was GREAT. I just struggled with the technical jargon, and the very realistic onslaught of very real issues that perpetually bombarded him, which in the end made me exhausted enough to abandon this book at 56% (though I later picked it up and read the last two chapters, which did finish very well). My issue; perhaps I didn't care so much if Mark Watney survived? Perhaps it was because it wasn't mentioned whether he had anything back home to survive for? I needed the pull, and I didn't find it.

  This is a page-turning read about a NASA astronaut left behind for dead after a manned Mars mission is cut short in a sand storm. The emphasis is very much on the science behind our hero's efforts to survive in the harsh environment of the red planet. He is a good humoured and resilient character but the novel (most of which is written as his log) doesn't really delve into the emotional depths of what it must be like to be the only human being a long way from home. It really is a thriller with lots of twists and turns along the way before the final outcome (which I won't reveal). I'm not at all surprised to learn that the novel will be turned into a film - there is lots of action here which will no doubt look well on the silver screen.

  NASA astronaut trapped on Mars following first manned flight to the planet has to find ways to survive - lots of problems encountered and solutions described.  Two-star reviewers said it is 'too technical' but it's all easy for the layman to understand, and surely that's the point of this book.  It's for science-fiction readers who like that sort of thing.  It seemed to me as a non-technical person that the author appears to have a good knowledge of how things might work in space, to have been able to think up all those difficulties and ingenious solutions.  The added interest is wondering whether he is going to be rescued, and if so, how.

  I will be brief. I got to the end of this book because, once caught, I needed to know how it ended, and not just by jumping to the final chapter. However, I probably only read about 60% of the content because the seemingly endless descriptions of Watney's activities on Mars frankly bored me and did not progress the story at all. So I was happily able to skip the majority of the second half with seemingly no loss of narrative flow. This is a novella that outgrew its skin, but didn't quite make it to be a full blown novel.

  This is the best novel I've read in ages.If you liked the tense sequences in Apollo 13 where the NASA teams have to come up with a way to build a working CO2 processor using just the junk that they know the space crew have with them in their command module or start the on-board computer with the tiny bit of power available, then you will love this story. It's really a series of engineering and scientific problem-solving exercises, explored primarily from the perspective of Mark Watney, an astronaut who is unlucky enough to be inadvertently abandoned on Mars after a bad storm. Put these elements together, and it adds up to a very inspiring and convincing account of one person's will to survive against incredible odds.The book is exciting, informative, plausible and often very funny.

  I read this book as the film looks great, however, I did not entirely enjoy the way the book was written.

  I enjoyed the film so I thought I’d give the book a go. Obviously things are adapted for the screen and that’s to be expected. And we all know books have much more detail than can be put in 2 hours of screen time. That being said. This book is wonderful. Mark Watney is such a likeable character, much more than the film.

  An astronaut is stranded on Mars after his crewmates leave during a violent storm, thinking he is dead.  This book tells of his fight for survival.I expected it to be good based on the reviews, but not as good as it is.  Andy Weir has crafted a brilliantly plausible story of a man ingeniously overcoming ever more challenging obstacles.  One of its most surprising aspects is one of the great reasons it works so well - the humour.  It is at times very, very funny.  Mark Watney (the astronaut) faces each new challenge with wit, a wit that keeps him going.It is the old cliche, a real page-turner, very hard to put down.  Hope leads to despair - hope springs forth again - rinse and repeat.  It's done brilliantly.  Can't wait to read more from the author.

  Brilliant film.  If you haven't watched it already, do.The film follows the book almost exactly.  The book gets a little intense in places if you don't like science.  Plenty of descriptions of feats of engineering which to a certain extent went over my head.  In the film these were simplified and I remember being in complete awe of the ingenuity.

  Although we have the video of the film we haven't watched it yet so I can't compare the 2.  The Kindle edition kept me up all last night reading.  I don't know how legitimate the science is but it certainly sounds plausible.  I enjoy the way he approaches problems to be solved: one problem aspect at a time and then approaching it step by step! Several reviewers have rated it poorly because of the science aspect - it doesn't read like a text book to me at all.  I'm finding the book full of humour and irreverent comments especially to the ground crew technicians who try to interfere with his ""on the spot"" methods.  Now they ARE trying to be too text-book rigid in their approaches.

  The author obviously researched the f@@k out of this. I liked the simple but intense writing style that carried the reader from the first page to the last page, holding my attention the whole way. Mark Watney must have been based on Matt Damon!

  Extremely enjoyable - couldn't put it down. I have no scientific knowledge so I might be easy to please but I was bowled over by the detailed explanations of the science and technology that enables an astronaut stranded on Mars to survive for two years (or thereabouts) with only the equipment and supplies intended to last six people 31days, and the escape/rescue attempts to save him. Andy Weir admits to a couple of cheats (no fierce winds on Mars apparently and no easy protection from radiation) and is disgusted (from a literary point of view) that water on Mars is now official. None of this detracts from the drama or compromises the rest of the science.

  Anybody who rates this 'poor' (and I've seen some dire reviews) is missing the depth that this book has to offer - particularly for those with a passing interest (or more) in physics and psychology. The text is mostly written in the first person, from the standpoint of a scientist / adventurer, so, whilst it may be somewhat pedantic in places, it narrates wonderfully as a study in the psychological profile of an astronaut. I genuinely cared about the guy, feeling his 'unwrittten' stresses and anxieties and powering through his achievements alongside him. For a book that I would consider easy-reading, it leaves enough of an impact to keep you thinking way after the last page is turned.

  I bought this due to the impending movie tie-in and wanted a holiday read for the plane and the beach.  This fitted well.  Most of the book is focused on the central character, as you would expect, and I started to think it was just going to be his narrative throughout and that it would be boring but it widens out to other characters and the story, for me, became much more gripping.  It's a good holiday read but you just have to get past the first bit with just Watney on his own.  I read it in about 3 days just picking it up and putting it down.

  For me, this is a 'couldn't put it down' book. It's mega-nerdy but to the point of enjoyable daftness (although I'm assured it's accurate ) the protagonist is completely unphased by his lengthy solitude because he's having such a fine time solving an ever increasing multitude of life threatening problems, mishaps and catastrophes. You'd expect this catalogue of technical wizardry would make him a boring character but you will just love his sheer childlike delight every time he wins out and also his his unbelievably high threshold of tolerating total discomfort combined with no pleasure!

At times, it gets a bit scientific - perhaps slightly overly so - but the character is completely believable and I found myself completely gripped with his predicament and everything he had to go through.

Given the recent space programme coverage, it is topical and relevant. What did impress me was the degree to which the technical and scientific knowledge of the author was pretty convincing in enabling his hero to survive alone on Mars for so long. I didn't feel this was in the realms of sci-fi, but rather a believable plot with no little green men. The storyline switches from the hero's audio diary to mission control's efforts to attempt a rescue. Well worth a read.

  Fast action adventure this is not.  What it is is a very believable story of an astronaut marooned on Mars and how, step by step he manges to piece together a means of survival. Other reviewers have criticised the ending, but I think the dramatic tension is held up well enough within the context of the story.  I liked the credibility of the issues he faces and the way he deal with them.  The author has gone to a lot of trouble to get as realistic as possible in how things happen.  The main character is also likeable, especially his flashes of humour.  The only real issue I have is everyone swears a lot, and sometimes this grated on me as being unnecessary and a bit over the top - but then that's a personal viewpoint.

The science all works as well, everything he does would work in a real life situation, even the soil thing (trying to keep spoilers down here). With regards to the film, it is pretty accurate, even in terms of dialogue, but it did miss some pretty significant events.

  I've enjoyed reading this book. The pace is quite snappy and it gives a convincing idea of what life would be like for anyone who found themselves stuck on Mars. The credulity is stretched a little by the lack of commentary on the psychological effects of being stuck in that situation, dealing with the mundane repetitive tasks necessary to stay alive for over 18 months. The astronaut remains insanely positive throughout the whole ordeal. The book also dwells on the mathematics of the situation a little too much.

Having said that, the author saves us from getting bogged down in secondary characters to focus on Mark Watney; the Everyman with a wry sense of humour and a ""can do"" attitude.Sometimes Watney comes across as indestructible, and even in moments of great peril, you feel he will make it, but the enjoyment is in seeing a man survive against the odds and still have a sense of humour.

  I was ready to put this book down and take it to my local charity shop but persifedered and I have to say what a cracking read. It reminded me of Gravity, I love the short chapters making it easy to read. I like Mark Watney however when the character spoke the words yay and yuk got on my nerves and that ruined the realism the book was trying to capture. I hope in my lifetime man will reach Mars and if the clever people at NASA and people like Mark it could happen! The techno muumbo jumbo when over my head but overall it is a senro which could happen.

  What a surprise! I haven't read a science fiction novel since I was 20 or so (now 60) but this was different. This book almost had me in tears in places and laughing out loud in others. A gripping novel from start to finish. I don't usually write reviews but I really had to this time. I was expecting a poor ending, after reading one of the reviews, but the ending suits the book perfectly. Strictly speaking it is Sci-fi. But so realistic as to appear contemporary, because of exceptionally in-depth research by the author, that it could be a report written last week! Highly recommended!

  Amazing book that I just ""happened upon"" a few months before the film was advertised. The film does not do the book justice. The book is far more dramatic and nail biting and really ropes you in. The highs and lows of this man's desolate stranding on mars are so vividly described that you are just rooting for his survival and rescue. Highly recommended but, preferably, before you see the film.

  An interesting premise but I'm not exactly sure how possible this survival story is. However, if you suspend disbelief and immerse yourself in this tale of how an astronaut is mistakenly assumed to be accidentally killed, so left behind on Mars then you are in for a treat. The physics is informative and makes his survival a little more plausible, if highly risky. I found myself cheering his successes and despairing over his failures but the most overwhelming joy in this book is the humour throughout.

  Usually writers comes up with idea original or not and then seek the advices and expertise of specialist in order to give matter and credibility to their imagination. With The Martian, the specialist decided to to the job himself. Unfortunately  for us he didn't seek any advice from writers.The result looks more like a math or science problem than a novel.Problems and solutions follow relentlessly without any building suspense. Literally no descriptions of anything character or environment but what serve the equation. Not one attempt at building a psychological profile not even the main character.only thing we know is that he is funny and cheerful, well he better be. Imagine someone stranded on mars alone for 18months left to feed on frozen dried potatoes and the only thing matters is how much hydrogen he can extracts from his pee.Such a shame as it is indeed my type of scenario and it could have been a really Good read.To resume obviously a serious science professor but someone with very little life experience. Which make this book flat and boring but still a bit entertaining. Would probably please the physician and chemistery nerds.

  I loved this book.  The premise is simple but engaging and I read this book within a couple of days.  The science parts may put people off but I actually loved it (maybe because I'm a scientist).  I think it adds a sense of realism to the story that you wouldn't get if you were just told that he ""made"" oxygen.  The characters are strong but their development never gets in the way of the story.  There's no huge romantic arc here, this is simple survival.One gripe I do have about all books made into films is that I don't want to see Matt Damon's face on the cover.  Original cover please?

  I read this book almost from cover to cover without a  pause.and, at times, I had to pinch myself that this was a novel and not a first hand account. The description of the equipment used and its failings under use was completely believable. The twists and turns as science and prediction turned out to be false, as so often happens in reality, was spellbinding. Just sufficient characterisation to put human flesh on the bones as each character actually did the job they had been trained for.A really good novel and thoroughly enjoyable for anyone with a slight technical bias or a ripping good yarn anyway

  This isn't something I'd normally read. Initially I found it a bit difficult to get into especially as there was a lot of print devoted to technical procedures and routines. However, I gradually got sucked into Watney's plight (the guy stuck on Mars) about half way through the book and the science and technical information became interesting - might be useful if you ever get stranded on Mars. It's not the greatest work of fiction but I don't think it was trying to be. It was entertaining and a good read with some useful science about Mars and space travel but with a human dimension. Towards the end I had to keep reading - I'll not spoil the ending.

  What makes a 5* book? A great work of literature, like Jane Austen? Or just a good read? For me a good read is only worth 4*, to get 5* it needs to exceed all expectations, it must be well written, the right length and have a well constructed conclusion. What I loved most about this book, was to take our understanding of Science, Biology, Chemistry and Physics and make some relatively difficult concepts to come alive and to engage and make the reader want to understand and learn more. This book is a successful fast paced action-thriller, without using any of the cliches normally associated with the genre.Back to my original point. Is it a great work of literature?

  I was unsure whether to buy this due to the amount of technical-speak in it, however, if you are in doubt, don't be - I thoroughly enjoyed it from page one and couldn't wait to get back to it every night to find out what would happen next.  Mark Whatney is a fabulous character who uses all of his training and knowledge (and a little bit of making-it-up-as-you-go-along!) to survive when he is left stranded on Mars.  There IS a lot of technical stuff but it's written in such a way that even if you don't really understand it, it doesn't matter.  If you are wavering, my advice - buy it!

  I've bought and read several kindle SF bargains over the past year and would rate this best for price and quality.  A gripping story of endurance, ingenuity and optimism in  the most testing of situations.  Some of the solutions worked out by Mark Watney to ensure his survival on Mars were a little too technical for a non-scientist like myself to fully understand, and some were also pretty nerve-wracking, definitely ones not to be tried out at home. Told with a quiet self-effacing humour in Watney's log, interspersed with the story of NASA's attempts to rescue. Highly recommendable.  One question: how did he cook his potatoes??

  Andy Weir has written a masterpiece. His knowledge of physics  and electromechanical engineering fits in beautifully with his story, and what a story.The idea of an astronaut being stranded on Mars is not new but Weirs` story surpasses anything previously written. The realization that Mark Watney was alone and had to rely wholly on his wits, training and sheer improvisation is a story that had me riveted to my Kindle in its entirety. This,with the interplay between Houston and Watney, kept the story going along nicely.If ever a book was crying out to be made into a blockbuster film,it is this one.  FULL MARKS.If

  Book miles better than film, and film is excellent. This book is well structured with events happening on Mars - and suddenly - new chapter and you're on earth desperate to know what's happening back on Mars. Clever device that really works. Thrilling, humorous and gripping. Genuinely wasn't sure how it was going to end. The thin thread of Watney's survival is stretched much tighter and more desperate in the book where you have more impression of passing time than in a 100min movie. Recommended.

  To say that this is the best science fiction novel I've read in years shows how exceptional I found it.

  The Martian is not quite what I expected, but is still a fun read, predominantly due to a likeable protagonist and just being very very clever. I thought the story would be a bit more action packed and tense than it is, and actually, not that much happens a lot of the time. It seemed a little ridiculous at first how much resources NASA were spending on saving him, but actually, in the real world they probably would. It's a little predictable in the end, but it's an enjoyable ride at least. And I'm pretty sure I learnt some science on the way, so it's educational too!

  Excellent! - A brilliant story well researched. This is the hardest of hard science fiction. No fantasy element is involved and yet the book is a gripping read with lots of lifelike risk calculations backing up the survival story of a stranded astronaut on Mars. I had long assumed that all science fiction would have to have some element of fantasy (eg faster than light space travel etc) in order to make a worthwhile story but this one treads new ground by being convincing without resorting to magic of any sort. I think maybe one or two minor descriptive aspects may stray slightly from plausibility but they amount to a lot less than the usual gross evasions of reality required to get a science fiction book off the ground.

  What reviews have said about this book were all correct, nice piece of writing and a real page turner, to be honest I found it inspirational as the main protagonist fought for survival as events seemed to conspire against him doing so. It also had an undertone, to me, about society today, how we in the west with our self-centred and hedonistic ways are ruining humanities chances of long-term survival with our throw away society, if like the the character in the book we repurposed more stuff, and made the best of what we already had, maybe we'd be living more efficiently and increase the longevity of our species.With my limited exposure to the topics within the book itself, Mr Weir seems to have well researched his work, everything seemed plausible and possible, which is an accomplishment itself -how many books have I reread sections because what the author said made no sense in the real world or in the context of what they had stated previously.Also, I think this incredible work is one-in-the-eye of mainstream publishing, who for years the author tried getting to take up his novel, they weren't interested -probably looking for the next Shades of Grey or Harry Potter...both books I'll never buy.I'd like to thank Mr Weir for getting me interested in reading again, not for a long time have I had a book I couldn't out down, I know he has other ideas on the way -I'd say the situation at book end could be one area to expand on- and if they are up to this standard I'll be buying them.

  An excellent book. This is my idea of a good science fiction yarn. It tells the tale of a man who is stranded on Mars when the rest of the crew, thinking him dead, leaves him behind. He has a habitat, but the communication system with Earth is destroyed and he doesn't have enough supplies to last till the next mission, which is four years away and will land 2,000 miles away. This is the story of his ingenuity as he struggles to survive...and the ingenuity of mission control when they realise he is alive. The idea reminds me of Arthur C. Clarke's 'A Fall Of Moondust'.

Waking up to being alone, he finds himself planning to survive on the planet before finally making contact with NASA in Houston via an old Mars probe, and the race to save him starts. Add to that a lot of good science (who knew that decomposing hydrazine would be so much fun), and you could get absorbed in it and forget the time!

  I really enjoyed reading The Martian and now can't wait to watch the movie. The book reads more like an apocalyptic thriller than sci-fi but still masterfully gets across the vast emptiness and hostility one could expect from Mars. I would definitely recommend this book to all others and will definitely be reading it again in the future.

  Brilliant, brilliant, brilliant! This book scores, for me, in two areas. Firstly it illustrates the tenacity of the human species. OK, it is a novel, a ""made up"" story, but if human beings were not capable of such determination to survive against all odds then we would not be here - and the story would not be as believable as it is. And it is very believable! Secondly, the characters created by Andy Weir are brilliantly crafted and I deny anyone to say that they do not relate to them, or that they find them artificial. I loved this book - thank you Andy Weir!

  I really enjoyed this book and to me this is the strength of kindle they create/encourage authors to publish and allow me to sample and then purchase a book I wouldn't have been able to purchase otherwise.  This book does have technical details but without the need to explain then in detail that didn't need, the story is about an engineer but managed to make the character quite real who acted and talked as real people do and not as a stereotypical engineer and I have worked with engineers who had less personality than this character.Would I purchase another book from this author, the answer would be a definite yes.

  I very rarely write reviews, but I must say that this book gripped me.  Some have criticised the amount of maths and science -  to me those were important is seeing how he logically thought through, and overcame, the string of threats that Mars threw at him.  I am sure 'experts' will find a few holes in the science, but to me it all seemed very believable.But the science was a backdrop to what is, in effect, a tale of Robinson Crusoe for the 21st century - a tale of dogged struggle for survival of an ordinary (but extraordinary) man.

  Loved it.  If you like a good bit of 'science' (I do) with your science fiction, then you'll like this. I've not looked at the author's biography but he must have some history in the rocket industry because the attention to detail is fantastic, which makes the story line (basically Robinson Crusoe on Mars) feel very plausible.  All the characters are interesting and the main character, Mark Watney, is fantastic - I was rooting for him from the opening page.  The story moves at a good pace, switching nicely between Earth and Mars.  I recommended to a friend and he read it in one go! I'll definitely keep an eye out for more of Mr Weir's work

  The continuous cycle of a problem appearing and the protagonist immediately finding a solution to it quickly kills any suspense for the rest of the book.

  I enjoyed this book and can entirely understand why it was turned into a film. Incredibly descriptive and atmospheric. I loved the way the central character managed to retain his sparky sense of humour despite the challenges. It lost one star for me due to what I thought was a slightly heavy hand with the science and maths. Very clever, and necessary at a level, but I found myself skipping parts from time to time.

  Frankly I was disappointed. A brilliant premise but it never fully engaged me. Although obviously a very clever and resourceful chap,  the main character's feelings about his predicament are never fully revealed, just his flippant sense of humour and determination to solve any problem. Same applies to all the peripheral characters, all rather faceless. The book lacks any real physical description of any person, thing or environment. I still found it fascinating from a technical point of view though! Perhaps the film will bring it to life better?

  They say that books are food for the mind...well this book was a banquet for the mind.Andy weirs consistent ability to create such incredible tention..And combine this with mark watneys blunt, dry and somewhat to the point humor is truely remarkable.Andys way of coveringEvery aspect of space, time, gravity and physics are also something to behold in its self...You know an author had done his homework when they know more about space and time than you do.The title ""the martian"" didn't personally appeal to me as such.When recommended one might think less of the book.But if you think about it, its a sort of inside joke to people that have read the book, as mark watley really IS a martian.This book (as it drew closer and closer to that sad moment when you have to depart from the characters that youve got to know so well over the course of reading this little portal to there world) made me laugh, cry, cheer, feel empathy and other strong emotions.

  Oh it Is very science-y, I have no idea if most of the science is true, but it was 100% believable. I really liked the characters, you get enough info about them to draw your own pictures of them without getting drawn into a load of emotional or sentimental crap. I like to whizz through a book quickly, and I soon realised I needed to pay more attention to the acronyms as they popped up, as they crop up a lot.  My sister recommended this to me, she loved it. It is my turn to pick for Book Club and they have never gone for SF before, so a great responsibility rests in my hands. Will they think the characters are developed enough?

  Loved this book. I read this before seeing the film and I have to say they did a good job on both. The book of course gives a lot more detail than is included in the film but the film gets the vast endless desert like surroundings spot on.I especially loved the gallows like sense of humor when he realizes that he's stranded a long long way from home and going to run out of Oxygen, water, food and everything else long before he will be rescued. The way he uses science to get him self out of one sticky situation after another is very impressive in the way its written as it could easily have come across as far too dry and technical.Will definitely look out for more books from this author.

  Quite simply one of the best books I have ever read. I could not not put this book down and finished it in a couple of days. Andy Weir magnificently conjures up a mix of sci-fi and action that keeps the reader gripped throughout. I was not taken by the diary/log format initially but I insist that you persist with it because with this style it allows Watney to recount his struggles, achievements and humorous  situations he gets into (mostly of his own doing) - it reminded me of Adrian Mole a bit, weirdly. When you think you have it all worked out Andy Weir some how manages to throw a spanner in the works and the whole story goes off down a different path.

Very believable math and science, perhaps a few less potatoes........  Fore what this cost it is unbelievable value for money, and well deserves to be a film.

  Great read.  While this was a technically engaging book there are a couple of issues which should be questioned from a  science perspective.  1) Hydrazine is strongly exothermic and if this is done in an enclosed space without adequate cooling its going to get rather hot! 2)  The dust storm.  Given the density of the atmosphere at the Martian surface no matter how fast the wind moved its going to little effect on a mass of a human or much else.  3) Little mention is made of the radiation risks.  That sort of exposure would require some technology we have not yet acquired.  Does not however degrade the excitement of the read -  well done and engaging quirky style.  Strongly recommended particularly for those with a science background who can understand some of teh detail.

  I bought this mostly based on the reviews not thinking it'd really be my thing, but I was definitely very wrong. Very much edge of your seat stuff, written in a way that's very accessible, and centreing on a character who manages to come across as very relateable. Despite how tense the situation is there are plenty of witty moments that stop the story becoming too oppressive, the messages back and forth and the translations from NASA speak to plain speak being the real highlights.The only thing that really does it's best to spoil the book is the woeful lack of proof-reading on the kindle version. There are spelling mistakes, added words, wrong words, missing words etc throughout, but particularly about a third the way through where you can find an example of this on pretty much every page for a significant chunk of the book.

  Don’t let the title or the synopsis put you off i.e. a man‘s been left on Mars presumed dead, not especially inspiring I thought. Take a look at the proportion of people who gave it 5 stars- they are not wrong.First of all, the main character is so likable I become emotionally involved in his predicament and cheered him on when things went well and couldn't stop reading when things went badly. He dealt with his situation with lots of humour (I laughed out loud on many occasions), a ‘can do’ attitude and some crazy ideas that might just save him or kill him!Secondly, there was lots of maths and science which for me made it very real, although this might put some people off.

  The Martian is a gripping, heart-felt story which kept me wishing my morning commute would last longer! Andy Weir delivers emotional punch in what would otherwise feel like a very science-heavy narrative. This is largely thanks to his highly likeable protagonist - who takes us through his desperate plight with charm and humility, whilst explaining in great technical detail how he is able to keep both his body, and his sanity, in tact! However, for me the book's main achievement is in reminding us that space exploration is not just about playing with big, expensive toys but about looking towards our shared, and very much inevitable, future. Perhaps most importantly, it's about coming together for a united purpose, and reminding us that we are all just human after all.

He's funny, sarcastic, intelligent and has the ability to think logically in the face of disaster. I recommend this book to anyone who asks - as well as the movie. Seeing it go from page to screen, or vise versa for me, really helped in visualising the situations Whatney found himself in and also how they not only adapted the story but also how they ""upgraded"" the technology to fit with the present day because let's face it, we're definitely more technologically advanced than when the book is set.

The twists and turns of fortune, disaster and failure heaping in an incessant barrage of challenges to the hero's resourcefulness. I had absolutely no clue how it was going to end.I would say to the author, if you ever consider making any changes, then just alter the sentence near the beginning that suggests the vessel will complete the whole journey to Mars in constant acceleration. It all comes clear later of course but it rankled a bit with me when I still hadn't realized what a gem of a story it was to be.

  OK book.  Read it before seeing the film.  Lots of detail, which can be jarring after a while.  Great if either before or after seeing the film.This really is a man on his own, left with only his intellect and resourcefulness - this side is not really shown that well in the film.

  Brilliant book! I love the science, it's not all Martians and improbable space disasters, everything is well thought out and logical, all the bad things that happen happen for a reason that the reader can relate to and the main character reacts to them as a human would. The technical details may be a bit off putting if that is not you thing but since it's my thing I didn't mind. In the end the main characters humour and determination to survive are what you most relate too, you feel like you know this guy by the end and you feel like you want to be his friend. Brilliant writing can't wait to see the movie now

  This book has lots of technical information included, which no doubt is necessary to explain how various problems which are encountered are overcome. However without understanding quite  lot of this, the storyline was so compelling that my enjoyment of this book was never compromised.It was a shame to get to the end of this book, but in fact I was so desperate to find out what happened that I continued reading till the early hours of the morning. Perhaps I will now go to see the film to find out if it can capture my attention in the same way.

  Disco hating astronaut Mark Watney faces almost certain death after he is stranded on Mars when a freak accident separates him from his crew mates during a near future manned expedition to the red planet.  This is the premise of Andy Weir's novel and it is quite an original and unusual read.  It is absolutely loaded with science, sometimes at the expense of forward momentum within the story but on the whole this works well as there isn't actually anything else going on. Watney is an enormously resourceful and wilful human being, fighting for his life in a hugely  hostile environment and the thing he has on his side is scientific knowledge and the ability to think his way round a problem. The first person narrative is dry as a bone and all the better for it. Watney is funny, believable and a recognisably credible geek scientist. I think we can expect a film adaptation of this one before too long.

  The odds against survival are astronomical (no pun intended) but our hero was obviously totally clued up science-wise. I enjoyed the read very much but was relieved to get to the finale if only to see an end to his isolation. All in all, an absorbing and (for the greater part) scientifically accurate story, which makes me think I would enjoy the film also.

  May have skipped a few pages to get through it but a good book. The characters are engaging but towards the end when you are rooting for him to be rescued the technical stuff, so good at creating a believable landscape at the beginning, starts to get in the way. Hence one or two skipped bits. But you do care about what happens to him so well written and enjoyable. Would definitely browse other books from this author

  Very enjoyable tale with some good surprises all along. It's also inspiring to truly appreciate how much scientific knowledge constantly saves the life of the main character (as much as his very human determination and creativity I must add). Highly repetitive immersion in math, chemistry and physics formulas do get tiresome at first but it's an efficient trick to progressively put the reader well in the realistic context and positively away from the usual glamorous description of astronauts routines. Glad I read it just before seeing it on screen.

  I thought this  was a great read. It is technically accurate (or close to accurate) and has a very real feel to it. If you have an engineering type of mind and are interested in space then this should be one for you. Too often books and films have fundamental flaws (in physics or emotions) in order to make the plot line ('Gravity' - what a waste!),  however here Andy Weir has written a story that rings true and stays true and makes a very satisfying read.

  I'll start by saying that I really, really enjoyed this book but it really puts the science back into science fiction - if you ain't bothered about the technical stuff you may not enjoy it as much as I did. Then again, I could be wrong...On the positive side the research is either meticulous or at least very convincing and adds weight to the plot, along with the depth of character development required to feel yourself really rooting for the space castaway, and his colleagues.I really enjoyed it... kept me turning those pages...

  One of the best sci-fi books I've ever read. I could not put it down and can't wait to see the film they are making with Matt Damon. Completely compelling and edge of seat action all the way through.

  This should be posted as one of the great science fiction novels.  I am no scientist but I have to assume that the science in this book stands up to scrutiny. The story is credible - no suspension of disbelief required here folks - and the characters are very real.  It is impossible not to care about what happens to the hero as he battles against almost insuperable odds.  I absolutely loved this book and would wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone who loves a good read.  This is not just for sci-fi fans.  It is a great human story, well written and packed full of drama through to the very last page.  Brilliant!

  I rarely feel compelled to write reviews, but this is a riveting read that deserves to be talked about. I read it in two sittings, couldn't put it down. I feel guilty almost at having read it so quickly because there has clearly been a lot of effort and research put into it. Though the story is quite different (and more complex in many ways), it put me in mind of the herculean efforts to bring the real Apollo 13 back. In fact the book is a sort of mix of Apollo 13 with Robinson Crusoe but obviously with a very different setting. Loved the characterisation and humour of Mark Watney btw (the main character).Clearly all reviews are subjective and you'll have to make your own mind up - try a free sample on Kindle first, but at least give it a go. In fact, at this price, just take a punt! I have read a lot of books this year already, but this ranks amongst the best so far, and certainly the least expensive. Will definitely be looking out for more work from Andy Weir - thanks for a well-woven story!

  Best story I've read in years and the most original by MILES. Astronaut gets accidentally stranded on Mars and has to adapt what equipment he has to survive and get home. Utterly believable and fascinating descriptions of the technology that could be used for Martian missions (mostly given via how Mark adapts it to survive). Even a total science ignoramus like me could follow it easily, thanks to the brilliant writing.In addition, Mark is the most likeable guy ever to grace the printed page (or, in this case, tablet!) with a marvellous sense of humour that had me laughing out loud more than once. Thank you Andy Weir, this is one I know I'll be reading again & again.Best moment?

  Good read. If you don't like science then the details may get to you at times. I thought the book was well written and had a good pace. You could feel the battle Watney was  having against Mars. The explanation about what was required to stay alive makes it clear how hard it will be to live off world. And was pleasantly surprised at how well the film stays to the story.

  The Martian is that rarest of rare things: a Techno-thriller that contains as much wit and deft writing as it does scientific fact and engineering specifications.It is also funny as all hell - laugh-out-loud funny even as the story demands our emotional investment.The story is set in the near future, during a mission to the titular planet, a mission which goes horribly, horribly wrong, leaving a single person - astronaut Mark Watney, stranded on the red planet, alive due to sheer dumb luck, but utterly alone and with no chance of survival.Not exactly a barrel of laughs and dramatically something of a foregone conclusion you might think and you would be right, except - except Andy Weir [1] writes with such humanity, and with so realistic a voice that you do indeed laugh as you are drawn into Mark's fight for survival (or perhaps more accurately, refusal to die): the only person on a ball of rock that is actively trying to kill him.The protagonist's snarky humour and sheer stubbornness are conveyed so well that the science of the book, contained in detailed descriptions of the various physical forces and technical challenges Mark must face, never intrudes or breaks our willingness to suspend disbelief.The premise of the novel  is established with verve and keeps our attention as the story unfolds, both in real-time and flashback, drawing in characters from some likely - and some very surprising - sources. The story is moved along organically, and never feels forced as Mark confronts, triumphs in each new ordeal and is then triumphed over in turn as his careful plans are shot to pieces by a capricious God of War. The pace can be slightly uneven however, particularly in the last third of the book, but to an extent this is a logical product of the narrative rather than any deficit in writing.I do not want to discuss the ending at all, but to save it for you to enjoy. I will say however that I have read many books that equally excited during the first couple of acts, only to disappoint in the worst way at the end. Rendezvous with Rama, I'm looking hard at you.In summary, this is a must-read book that transcends the cheap pigeon-holing I did at the start of this review. It contains ""hard science"" elements and it is set in the future, but it is not as one dimensional as some Hard science fiction. It is funny - hilariously so on occasion - but it is not a comedy.It is a book about humanity when confronted with impossible odds; it is about me, and you and everyone and it is wonderful. Go buy it, now.

The story is a genuine roller-coaster-page-turner with suspense, humour, human spirt, excitement and immaculately timed swearing!

  I chose to read The Martian before seeing the film and I am glad I have made that decision; it makes me want to see it all the more, even though I know what happens.From one liners, good science based information to the general overall good feel of Mark Watney's story, makes The Martian catching and undoubtedly sucks you in.A subtle thing about this story is that it doesn't dwindle on Mark Watney's numerous experiences on the lonesome red planet, as it would easily become laborious. It's the right amount of detail before the story moves on.

  I loved this book! So may fantasy and sci-fi relies on a suspension of disbelief - but not when you read this. The science of it is just so good, and done in a way that makes it so riveting - you are thinking ""how will he get out of this situation, when there is going to be no amazing coincidence, no bit of magic, and no odds defying roll of the dice"". Instead we get a constant stream of ingenuity, and also humour in the face of adversity. Brilliant.

  Overall the book was good some early parts the number details were a bit tedious, a bit heavy but got better as the story progressed. The ingenious and continuous  solutions were a fine example to keep going. The middle section bring in the earth based factors greatly enhanced the story to take the book into compulsive reading which would rate a 5 star book.  In conclusion  overall 3 stars perhaps is harsh and should be 4 stars. Not sure I wish to watch the film because you know the outcome. The journey looks like a potential follow up story.

  This book inspired me to write my own science fiction. The reason being the the incredibly detailed feel to the science, the human fallibility when dealing with technology and the quirkiness of the experience that he goes through. All of it had a profound impact on how I viewed sci-fi books. I had always enjoyed them, there was either always lots of one thing or the other, loads of detail or loads of atmosphere, but this seemed to be written the way I hoped I could write. Hence it was very very inspiring. I usually watch the films of any books I have read, but I feel it may break the magic for me, however good it is as a movie.

  The Martian is a well written book that keeps moving all the way and you can't help but grow to care about the central protagonist Mark Watney and his constant battle for survival.

  Whilst the willingness to dig into the technical jargon and ideas expressed in the book is a must-have, it is a fascinating and very different exploration of being stranded on Mars.Many books dealing with this subject seem to have a near-idiot accidentally find a way to survive and focus more on the dire loneliness than the reality. The Martian instead has a well-trained astronaut fight to survive with the real limits being lack of resources and equipment not built for the task. His struggle is much more realistic and much more dependent on his skills rather than luck. There's no deus ex machina here.Overall a sold read with a really interesting premise.

  This is the story of a man who is left on Mars when a space mission goes wrong.  He is wrongly presumed dead, and the book starts with his diary of how he survives.It continues both on earth and on the space ship he had previously been on.I think it would help if the reader has a knowledge of chemistry (which I don't have), but it isn't necessary.

Although full of very accurate science it also has its funny moments with the main character watney cracking jokes from some 140 million miles away which frustrates the heck out of nasa but broke up the sometimes nerve wracking moments in this book where it all goes wrong for watney several times.You are rooting for watney from the outset.

  Loved this book. Shame on any that gave it low star rating, I feel it must be due to your lack of understanding of the science , rather than any fault in the book. Of course some of it is slightly far fetched, but, after all, it is science FICTION! However, having said that, most of the science is sound. I loved this character, his humour was brilliant. Those who feel it was misplaced must, themselves, be humourless individuals.  Humour gets us through the most dire of circumstances. I made myself late for work a couple of times because I  had to read 'just one more bit'. Stayed awake until the early hours to finish it, and then was sad when I did! Cannot wait for the film!

  Highly entertaining and suspenseful book - gave me quite a few chuckles and kept me looking forward to going back to it and see what happens to Mark Watney. Very impressive amount of research has quite clearly gone into this book in term of getting the science right (or at least as right as possible for a suspense novel). One point of positive criticism would be the writing style. Personally I would have appreciated a slightly more sophisticated style of writing, although it is of course intended as Mark Watney's first person diary for most of the time. But all in all a very entertaining novel that I would recommend to anyone who loves science-fiction, science without the fiction or anyone who just loves a different style page turner.

  This wasn't the sort of book I'd normally choose but having read the reviews and how many people thought how good this book was I decided to give it a go. I loved the way you were straight into the story from page 1. There was no character building or heading back into the past at any point to explain how the characters had reached this point and it wasn't necessary. I loved the characters instantly and felt I'd known them for ages without any further explanations. It was a rollercoaster of a ride and the humour in it was perfect. It could have been depressing but instead it was very uplifting and showed off the human mind and the will to live to perfection. A brilliant read, I'd recommend it to everyone and anyone.

  The crew of Ares 3 have aborted a Mars surface mission, leaving behind a botanist they believe to be dead. NASA, overseeing their long journey home from back on Earth, is dealing with the fallout from the failed mission and the death of botanist Mark Watney.Except Watney is alive and well - for now anyway. Stranded on the hostile and barren planet Mars with no way to communicate with Earth and fast running out of supplies and life support, Watney's struggle to survive the unfolding days, weeks and months is recorded in his log with black humour, sarcasm and unflinching optimism. Faced with ever growing and insurmountable odds (hunger, freezing temperatures, dust storms) and the realisation that even if Earth finds out he isn't dead, any potential rescue is years away, Watney's mission now is to stay alive, contact home and get rescued. Oh, and also to grow the first ever potatoes on Mars.

  The first few chapters are written in playful first person diary format, which may not be to all tastes, but this only used for the one character, and when others are brought in the comic first person style becomes less problematic.The plot is a good one, the storytelling is compelling enough, the science is expert and no character is either obviously a 'goodie' or a 'baddie', all are fleshed out sufficiently.A genuine hard sci-fi instant classic.

  My first review in ten years but felt compelled to do so for this book. Others have already summarised the plot so I won't do that here. Instead I'd like to comment that the book is clever, funny, entertaining and has a lead character who is genuinely likeable and believable. For this reason you find yourself rooting for him at every step of his struggle on Mars. When things go wrong you'll feel his pain and wonder how the hell he's going to get out of the latest mess.I think the author has got the pace and length of the book spot on too. I particularly liked that he picked the right time to switch the focus back to what was happening on Earth. Lastly, I'd like to congratulate Andy Weir on sticking in lots of lovely science into the book. Even better, in my opinion he does this without ever confusing the reader. Instead you will probably learn some things without realising you're doing it.Overall, this is a great read and I look forward to more from this author.

  A good book for fans of space technology, with only the occasional technical inaccuracy such as the fact that the Martian atmosphere is too thin to support winds that could blow over a rocket. The author clearly has a lot of technical knowledge on space technology and has done an impressive job in thinking of everything that could possibly go wrong on a Mars expedition and then working out ingenious, technically feasible ways to put them right.However, the author’s writing style seems like it was honed writing NASA instruction manuals, and you don’t get involved emotionally with any of the characters.

I'm not sure where you can go from here but I will definitely be looking out for your next book.

  Liked the plausible interesting plot - extraterrestrial Robinson Crusoe - suitably backed up with relevant maths if you are so inclined - particularly because  in the not too distant future, it could be a true life story! A plot which could be readily converted into a screenplay ? Thought it sped up a bit toward the end - maybe another crisis or two on the way home? Nevertheless an intriguing storyline especially if you enjoy space travel themes

  What a great read, I seem to have lost a weekend as couldn't put it down.  I've never listed a review before but felt I had to in this case, and I even had to create an on line name ( read the book to understand). This is a wonderful story of positivity, determination and resourcefulness against extreme odds.  As other reviewers have noted there is a lot of scientific explanation but don't let that put you off in any way as you don't need to understand it ( I certainly didn't) to enjoy the adventure.I've read that somebody has taken up film rights and I think they are onto a winner with this one - I'm already enjoying speculating about who could play mark Watney - tom hanks would be too obvious ( and probably too old sorry tom) I'm thinking perhaps brad Pitt........  Thoroughly recommend this book quite a shame it's listed under science fiction as it's really a contemporary fiction story set in the near future.

  I am often put off by many books which go under the banner ""science fiction"" as science often play little or no part. This novel ""The Martian"" however lives up to the label. It is both highly plausible in its scientific content and highly readable in the fictional novel sense. It left me feeling for the characters and admiring their great inginuity. I would recommend this to any avid reader of the genuine ""science fiction"" genre.

  A good read, a page turner.  I let a few people borrow this book before I read it and they all enjoyed it and went on to see the film.  I liked the book, but for me the main character did not convince me as an astronaut.  This occasionally broke the illusion for me.  That said, it's still worth a go and I take my hat off to the author's attention to detail.  Recommended.

  This is a great book, especially for the measly sum of 77p!It's very well written and well structured, with the documented interactions of the Stranded Mark Whatney on Mars, the characters back on earth and his crew mates on hermes keeping the reader interested.Mark plans a lot on mars, and also does a lot of math. The description of which is interesting and great for some, but not fully suited to me as I can get hung up on the details.

  The Martian is a breath of fresh air for me, it is a sci-fi novel based around the survival of 1 man on mars mostly written in the first person in a diary format, which plays to the strengths of the main protagonist. The man himself has a great sense of humour and he carries the story comfortably on his own. It is whimsical, deadly serious and a pleasure to read from the first page to the last.What this isn't is a masterpiece of sci-fi. What it is is a great read.

  I am an unconditional fan of Sir Arthur Clarke; his undoubted humanism, believe in human capabilities to endure, his optimism, imagination & science knowledge are superb. Andy Weir is maybe the first contemporary science fiction writer who is knowledgeable enough to draw my attention. Like Sir Arthur, he is witty (I fought myself LOL many times while reading The Martian several times), he believe in human intelligence to endure & he is an optimist, everything I like. I hope his next books will be as enjoyable & as good as this one is.

  The premise is simple; An astronaut is stranded on Mars and needs to find a way to survive and get back to Earth. That's literally it and what you have is 363 page turner which reads like Robinson Crusoe starring Bear Grylls on Mars where the planet itself is the enemy.The lead character, Mark Watney is very accessible in that he's very human. He's smart, he's funny and has to deal with life's monotonous task but at the same time, he's human and he swears when he's angry, he can be overconfident and often makes mistakes, some of which frequently try to kill him. It never stops him from trying though and that's a real testament to the development of the character and Andy Weir's story tellingAdd to that a supporting cast of diverse people, people. inanimate machines that develop ""characters"" of their own and technical languages that threaten to teach you more than you realize, you're in for a thoroughly enjoyable adventure. If this doesn't get turned into a blockbuster movie in the next couple of years, I'd be shocked beyond belief because I'm waiting to buy my ticket.Until then, pick it up, buckle up and throw on some 70's Disco because you're in for a treat ;-)

  Written in a matey style, sweary and amusing, this is 'hard' sci-fi as in it is based on realistic (or apparently realistic) science as we know it now, in the tradition of the hallowed Arthur C Clarke. I'd say the science is not as good as Clarke - who could compete with the man who dreamt up geostationary communications satellites? - but the writing and characterisation are more contemporary and great fun.

  At last a piece of genuine science fiction about Mars exploration which doesn't involve bug eyed monsters or astronauts turning into bloodthirsty zombies after drinking the water!The premise of this book is entirely believable and the level of detail is extraordinary. The author obviously has an in depth knowledge of the intricacies  of orbital dynamics and survival on the hostile world that Mars is.The level of technical detail may be a bit much for some readers, but for me it's what makes this book. It addresses the real challenges that an astronaut would need to overcome to survive in this environment. It's certainly one which will be appreciated by anyone who has a genuine interest in space exploration (the aficionados will appreciate the reference to a ""plugs out test"").If you've seen the crap that is ""Gravity"" this will come as a welcome change.Read it.

  I started reading sf when I was about 12 years old when my dad gave me a copy of the Foundation Trilogy. For the next 10 years I read nothing but Asimov, Clarke, Van Vogt and all the other old masters. Andy Weir has managed to take me back to those early experiences with this fantastic novel. If you've read any Jack McDevitt you'll understand where i'm coming from as I feel his writing is also quite old school. It has been quite a while since I have, literally, been unable to put a book down. I got into trouble at work for over running my lunch break on several occasions. His prose and characterisation are spot on so that you really root, not only for Mark Watney but also all the people back on Earth trying to help him. I really can't recommend this book enough. If you want some old school sf with slightly more modern edges that will keep you gripped to the last page, then this is for you.

  Highly original premise for a novel and very topical at the moment given the proposed Dutch mission.The protagonist lurches from solving one almost certain disaster through a seemingly never ending series of impossible challenges.

  Sorry, but to get 5 stars it would have to be a classic.  It is an original idea and was better written than many in this genre,  but certainly not in the same league as the science fiction 'greats'.  In my view, it is a solid middle ranking novel.What spoilt it for me?  The all too frequent science and technology explanations became very wearing.

  Many reviewers have started with a synopsis of the story, so  won't repeat that here. Suffice it to say that if you like SF and technology you will love this book. Much of the technology is something that can be related to in terms of the present state of the space exploration program. Normally I would read in bed and invariably fall asleep with  the book closed and lose my place. This did not happen with this book, rather I had to force myself to put it down.

  I didn't expect to like this as much as I did. New science fiction with believable science is (sadly) quite rare, but I got the impression that this guy had really done his homework. I also liked the main character - his irreverence was a nice counter to his indefatigability and stoicism. The parts set on earth were weaker, but this perhaps reflects that these interludes are only there to help along the main thrust of the story, which essentially only features one character.

  One of my favourite books in the last year. Film was good but read the book it is witty and tense. For once the science seems plausible too (the uber geeks will shoot it down in flames no doubt but then that's how they get their enjoyment from these things). As this has been kicking around for a while now - if you haven't read it do. It will show up there with the classic stuff.

  An awesome book! It had me gripped from the beginning. Although some of it was hard to follow (the scientific/technical stuff) it didn't detract from the storyline. I was rooting for Watney to make it home. I loved how resourceful he was and how he managed his situation with humour. I was gutted when the book ended. The only disappointment for me- I would have liked more info on Hermes making it back to earth and the obvious celebrations there would have been.

  The writing is strong and sometimes funny, but there's WAY too much detail for me. It's obvious that Andy Weir knows a lot about botany and electrical engineering, which would have been interesting in smaller doses. That said, it's worth wading through the minutiae for such a solid story.

  As an infrequent reader of fiction, I expected this to be a struggle.Not so ... very easy, interesting, enjoyable.For the painstaking nerds, plenty of ideas to check and follow through. I don't have that kind of time/energy, but got the impression that a very wide spectrum of scientific and technical research has gone into the creation of the book.While some understanding of the technical issues (which is all I can claim) is helpful, the story is meaningful and gripping even without a full-on science background.

  A truly gripping read, this tale of one man's fight to survive on his Martian desert island is undoubtedly a thrilling page-turner - or Kindle-tapper. Undoubtedly there are reasonably lengthy passages of technical and scientific content, but for the less scientific amongst us - and I include myself in that group - it is never a barrier to enjoying the ride. Rest assured that Mark Watney probably knows what he is doing, so we don't need to worry!Highly recommended.

  I found my way to this book when I had a craving for some Sci-Fi. Reading the synopsis left me initially skeptical; a man stuck on his own on Mars sounded a little boring.It wasn't.Simply put, The Martian is one of the best books I've read in a long time, and I enjoyed it immensely. It follows (mainly) the trials of the protagonist, Mark Watney, as he struggles to survive after being stranded on Mars. What made me really love the book was how incredibly easy it was to engage with and be immersed by it. It takes place not long from the present day, meaning the technology is not too far removed from our own. There is nothing unbelievable or ridiculous, which lets the reader empathize well with Watney's situation.The narrative structure is really clever too. It mostly takes the form of logs made by Watney during his time on Mars, the first person perspective giving the reader a good insight into not only what is happening, but what Watney is thinking and how he is feeling. Add to this that Andy Weir created a character who uses humour to help himself get through things makes this not a only a gripping read, but also at times a very funny one.Sometimes the narrative deviates from the logs. These segments serve not only to keep the reader informed of what is going on in the grander scheme of things, but also to add suspense. More the once during these segments I felt a sinking feeling of dread in my stomach, convinced the end had come, only to be astounded at how Watney and NASA dealt with whatever had occurred.In conclusion... buy this book! You'll enjoy it, it and it deserves to be read. And for 77p there really is no excuse.

  A brilliant combination of science and narrative, this text is a fascinating and captivating read from beginning to end.

  Read this in a day. Plain and simply; it's just a fantastic book.Mark,  our protagonist, keeps a log whilst he is stranded on Mars and it is this that we read throughout the vast majority of the book. It is this method of writing that also really helps the reader emphasise with Mark.As a character he is superbly written with pages that seem unforced and are genuinely laugh out loud funny in places.Where the author deviates from the 'log'  device,  it is to good effect and to provide some occasionally context to what is happening elsewhere.A really good read recommended to readers of all fiction.

  Instead of stringing you along each chapter (like Dan Brown does), this book gives you a small reward every few pages. I personally dislike books written from a first person perspective, but here it's nicely done in the form of a log. Also, I haven't experienced a page turner like this since the Harry Potter books first came out, and I think that comparison works because this book can be a bit juvenile at times. For the last couple of years I've exclusively read non-fiction, so the real world research explained throughout this book made the transition back to fiction nice and smooth.

Instead of creating improbable machines set in dystopian futures, this book got right back to basics with a great survival tale based on some hard science.When reading the first few chapters I worried that I might tire of the whole book taking the style of a personal log/journal, but happily this didn't last too long and was combined to great effect with other styles of writing throughout the book.If you are a fan of the first couple of Ben Bova Mars books then this will probably be just what you're looking for.I can't wait for the next book from Andy Weir...hurry up!

  Absolutely loved the book even though I watched the film first. Beautifully written, providing a lot of depth to the character and situation.You were with Mark Watney through his injuries, finding out he was left behind, the struggles at staying alive, eating his microwaved potatoes to his journey to get home.Brilliant and definitely a must read, even if like me you saw the film first.

  There's some good science (botany, engineering, chemistry), plus a likeable protagonist and plenty of humour. There's also Mars as a properly indifferent killer menace. Like I said in my headline, The Martian is Robinson Crusoe on Mars - with Pathfinder (the probe) playing the part of Man Friday.

  My initial impressions of this book were poor, in particular I found the main character pretty annoying and didn't find his witty teenager behavior all that convincing. As the book carries on though he grows on you and the story gets more and more interesting as he continually struggles for survival. Some of it was a bit technical but that's a small complaint.

  An absolutely superb story; it held me from start to finish and that doesn't happen very often! It is a very convincing tale and although I have no means (nor aptitude) to verify the various science, maths and technical aspects it all seemed plausible enough. The main value of the story is that optimism and aspiration can work wonders but, best of all, it is beautifully written and, in places, delightfully funny. If only more ""science fiction"" matched up to this. As they say, a must read!

  I used to be an avid sci fi reader but have not bothered in years. The outline of this novel caught my attention and I am so glad it did. I haven't enjoyed a yarn like this for ages. The characters are so real and events so plausible you feel like you are there every step of the way, whether through the main protagonist's eyes in the first person or following the interplay of the others in dealing with the rescue mission The author has created every event as if it were real and has you gripped waiting each resolution.

  A really enjoyable read, I didn't expect it to make me laugh nor to be a page-turner.  I was unsure how I would react to a story which is largely monologue but Watney is thoroughly likeable and frequently funny. The science feels robust, and yes there are a few lucky escapes, but what shines through is Watney's incredible resourcefulness and resilience in the face of absolute adversity.  I hope the film does it justice. Recommended to anyone looking for a light hearted read and who hates flakey science!

There's not much to say about it's originality (Apollo 13 meets Gravity meets Robinson Crusoe) but the execution of the story is near perfect in my opinion. I can clearly see why the book was optioned for a film adaptation even before its release, as the story has a movie-like progression.

There are enough moments of real jeopardy amongst the drudgery of the hero's existence to propel you through the book.

  I really enjoyed this book! I saw it on Amazon, read the ""Look Inside"" extract on my Kindle and had to buy the book, there and then. I don't know how accurate any of the science is, but it certainly SEEMS authentic (which is what matters in a novel), and in Mark Watney Andy Weir has created a memorable character with a great slant on life, the universe and everything, as Douglas Addams would have put it.Buy this book - it's well worth a read!

  I don't normally write these BUT after reading The Martian which by the way I couldn't put down. I felt the need to write this, if you only read one book this year make sure it's this one, the story telling is compulsive, your invested in Mark Watneys survival, you laugh, cry yes you cry!

  Enjoyable story, with lots of detail.  For me though, there was a bit too much focus on technical details (i.e. the calculations for splitting molecules for various uses) which I tended to skim over and preferred the character sections.  However, it was an interesting read, and did keep me interested.  Not sure if I actually liked the lead character, but nonetheless an interesting premise.

  Do not read this book if you have anything else to do. From the start it is an all involving work that is so believable it would be impossible to write without thoroughly researching NASA and its procedures. It is written on the assumption that if something can go wrong then it will go wrong at the worst possible time. Think Robinson Crusoe meets Apollo 13 then double it. I hate Sci Fi that has bad science or invents new science. This is so true to life that you will feel you have been there. Forget the first sentence. If you have anything else to do then forget it.

  In the near future, due to an unfortunate series of events, an astronaut gets left behind on Mars. What follows is an engineering-driven story of one man struggling to survive against the odds in a harsh environment. Like other classic castaway fiction, this setup has you rooting for the protagonist throughout, suffering through their setbacks and cheering their successes, making it a very engaging read. If you're into softer sci-fi (more of a social/psychological side) or the far future (aliens, FTL travel and laser guns), this might not be the book for you; on the other hand, if you're interested in a narrative-driven look at what's possible with broadly contemporary technology, it could be right up your street.

  One of the most tense and exciting books I've read for ages. Bit like a fictional Apollo 13, but more. Astronaut gets left behind on Mars, overcomes one disaster after another to try and stay alive. Just when you think it s going to be OK, there's always another problem. Written in the style of the astronaut's diary it feels very personal and real. Don't start it unless you've got time to finish it in one go.

  Mark Watney is a superb protagonist for this story. His earthy humour and inate intelligence suit him well to the role of survival as Space Crusoe. Andy Weir' s writing is consistently clear and snappy, keeping the story rollicking along at a fair clip. He manages to pull off that tricky manoeuvre of putting the sci- into sci-fi without overwhelming the story or losing the characterization.  Highly recommended!

  I'm a bit dissapointed about this book. Don't get me wrong, it is fantastic, but it doesn't really appeal to me. A lot of the book consists of scientific, mathematic rants that simply just fly over your head. That's the only discrepancy I can think of. All other aspects are fantastic, the speech is great, flows well and is funny in some parts. The plot is great and does indeed keep you on the edge of your seat. It's not the best read in my opinion, but I am a bit fussy to be fair. Overall a good book, discounting the scientific rants of course.

He certainly doesn't want to give up, but can he use the equipment he has around him to extend his survival time?  Can he find some way to contact earth? Told through the log he keeps as he battles the elements, the resourcefulness and invention he shows keep providing hope, but a combination of the harsh environment and bad luck seem certain to condemn him to live the rest of his days on Mars.

  Keeps you reading, series of life threatening problems followed by ingenious solutions. Some of the disasters are trailed so you have a hint of what is coming. Not unlike the movie Gravity in premise this time set (mostly) on Mars. Science is well researched and authentic. Probably will appeal to the inner geek in all of us.

  I just finished The Martian by Andy Weir, I was doubtful at first as I'd never heard of him but at 77p I thought you can't really go wrong.I was gripped from the start and the roller coaster ride this book delivers was just fantastic. I remained gripped al l the way through and pretty much read it continuously to the end. its been a long time since an author pulled me in like that. The main character is believable and I quickly found myself routing for him and worrying about what would be thrown at him next.I would happily pay £5 to read this book, it should be a best seller and really needs to be made into a movie. Please can we have more from this author.Trevor Hadfield

  Excellent read! But don't have wrong expectation, it's not about psychology, sadness, or any such thing. It's about problem solving. A book written by a DIY guy, for DIY guys.The writing style is very 'efficient' : anything that's not useful is removed, no lengthy description, unless it contains clues to the next step. That makes the book quite quick and easy to read.And it gives hope, that sooner rather than later, mankind will make a step on another planet.It's also quite humorous.

  Apparently some people don't like this book as the main characters personality and occasional immaturity winds them up. I think he is one of the most real characters I have ever read about.

  As with previous reviews, I've found this book difficult to put down.  It doesn't mess about trying to set up the story and drops straight in to the story at the point the main character has found himself marooned and believed dead.  The log (diary) entry style works well, allowing for bite size segments that seem to automatically make you just want to keep reading and as others have said the technical side of things is handled well and is very believable (I'd say plausible but I'll leave this to someone with more knowledge of the realities of actual space missions).Currently,I'm only hitting about 40% of the book read but enjoying this immensely.Good book, highly recomended.

  Some people may find this book too detailed or intricate, or may find the regular use of maths to move the story on off-putting. These were the very reasons I found it fascinating. The maths of survival faced by the main character are brutal in their simplicity, yet he faces them with humour and creativity in equal measure.The beginning is a little light in tone, but once the main story gets underway you are rapidly gripped and can't help rooting for all of the characters, whatever their faults. A mark of the quality of the writing is that you will not know until the very end whether the story ends happily or not.

You can not put it down but I recommend that you take your time to read it and really experience being on Mars for a while.

  A really enjoyable book, but I like a lot of the detail used to describe the solutions our hero engineered in the interests of self preservation! Not everyone will, I realise. Also, you care about the main character, he's a funny, warm guy and whilst he doesn't give up, he's not your typical, square jawed, broad chested hero you might expect. The first book I've read for a while that I was really keen to back to when I wasn't reading it.

  Bought this when bored n a hotel bedroom figuring that at £0.77, even if it was crap it would be no great loss.  And you know what?  It wasn't crap at all!  I was gripped, it was first and foremost a great idea for a novel, a man totally alone fighting for survival in an environment so inhospitable it makes you wonder why Ranulph Fiennes has so many problems in Antarctica, when it's such a holiday camp by comparison.  Exciting, funny in places, well thought out and actually eminently plausible as well.  Thoroughly recommended.

  A good book, but let down in places. At times Watney is a little too one dimensional, Weir possibly should have delved into the psychology of the main character, to make him more believable. The science and the actual situation though, seem for the most part, well written and plausible. A decent, readable book, but falls short of a higher score from me.

  Brilliant. Definitely a bloke's book, it's well researched, clever and a real page turner. Although it's clearly sci-fi there's an element of thriller about it too - the puzzles he has to solve happen to be set on Mars and are coloured by the setting, but in essence it's about problems that have to be solved and so less pure sci-fi than just intelligent fiction.

  This is real science fiction in the style of Arthur C Clarke. The story hinges around the technical difficulties faced by the main protagonist who has been marooned on Mars. If you are interested in space exploration (and if you aren't, you won't have got to this page anyway), enjoyed Apollo 13 and like a good, straightforward story, then you will love this book.There is loads of technical detail - which I loved. Actually the technical detail is what this book is all about (after all, he is alone on Mars - it is unlikely to be a love story).

  A well paced novel, with an accessible protagonist, but which occasionally lapses into too much science-detail. It's an enjoyable read with page-turning plot devices that keep you engaged. I alternated between the Kindle and audiobook versions, which sync seamlessly across devices. My only concern was the novel's time-setting utilising props from 1970's pop and TV cultures. But this is minor compared to the compelling nature of the situation. It's a thrill ride throughout. Treat yourself to a roller coaster ride on Mars.

  Its really didn't take much concentration to get into this book. Before long I was hooked.  The way it is written is enough pace to keep it from becoming stale and the science is what makes it seem real.  On the other end of the scale, I'm sure the science is what also makes it implausible, burgeoning on ridiculous to many with a better understanding of botany, physics and extra terrestrial pyrotechnics.  But as the title suggests, entertaining.  Great story, enjoyed by a dreamer.

  I very rarely pick up a book. Very rarely. But on a recent business trip to Cincinnati I was compelled to borrow my son's kindle and get a book. Can't remember how I stumbled across this but I'm interested in sci-fi, but realistic sci-fi. Started reading at the start of the 8.5 hour flight and couldn't put it down! Got a little too technical for me in places but my son read it later and enjoyed those parts the most. I'm more interested in the drama of which there was a lot. Should be made into a film on day although something similar was done in 'mission to mars'. I say similar very loosely. For me this was far more believable. 11 outta 10.

The central character Watney is the coolest, most resourceful and optimistic nerdy astronaut dude ever imagined and will have you rooting for him all the way. There are plenty of laugh-out-loud moments, alongside instances of butt-clenching panic!

Looking forward to reading it again very soon.

  Stick with this one. The first 1/4 is a bit repetitive and the main characters thoughts are more juvenile than trained astronaut.But its good , a bit predictable in that you know something else is bound to  come up against him.As they're making this into a film, I had a look at who's who.

  Got this for free a few days ago, not expecting it to be anywhere near as good as it is. Very well-written and a proper page-turner. Obviously well-researched, the story is set a few years in the future and the science is (as far as I can tell!) sound. There is a lot of sciencey stuff in this but it's essential to the story and doesn't detract from the novel's brilliantly realised characters, tension and atmosphere (no pun intended!) It would make for a fantastic TV mini-series (too long for a film) and I'm looking forward to see what Andy Weir comes up with next.

  Recommended by Martin Lewis (yes, the money-saving guy!).  What's great about this book is the meticulous research and huge attention to detail. I don't have the technical knowledge to confirm there are no plot-holes, but the author has taken a lot of trouble to fill in the background at every stage. Simple, compelling story and believable characters.  I recommend it, too.

  First time I've been compelled to leave a review but few books have got me like The Martian did.  Utterly engaging it reads like a blow by blow account, the characters so real that each twist and turn leaves you thinking about each chapter long after you've put it down.  Yes the science is full on in places but I loved it - it only adds to that sense that it is all actually going on and NASA have sent folk to Mars - completely suspends your disbelief, everything a good book should be!

This is certainly more of a story about one man's survival than it is science fiction and as such makes for an enjoyable read. The narrative is well written and there are several points where humour just pops-out unexpectedly. Andy has written this book in such a way that you can really associate to the main character and be taken along in his journey of survival.

  This book is a real page-turner.  I don't read a great deal of 'hard' science fiction, but I loved the way the humorous hero Mark Watney problem-solved his way throught the story against almost insurmountable challenges.  I was rooting for him from the first page.  The story is well structured, to keep the reader guessing until the end.  It is like 'Apollo 13' on Mars and I'm sure a film will be forthcoming. Highly recommended.

  I enjoyed the read and the clever actions taken by our hero. The story was authentic but in many ways I would have liked more philosophy on the way our hero found himself and how that might change his life looking to the future. We found out little about the major events in his early and late past. Andy Weir is a true scientist and well done and I am looking forward to the film

  Bought this on spec thinking it was something about a Martian coming to earth or suchlike. Instead it's about an astronaut who gets stranded on mars and his struggle to survive. Told with lots of humour and some of the ideas are worthy of a Sherlock Holmes novel. Only criticism is that it's a little too long.

  Back in the '60s I used to read science fiction. I mean scientific fiction, not the science fantasy that we see so much of today. Martian is in that mould. Like Arthur C Clarke's ""Fall of Moondust"" it could really happen, and there's no alien races or magical powers involved. As a film it is much more believable and spectacular than Gravity. More characters. More of a plot. More action. Definitely worth reading.

If you want a good easy to read fast paced sci-fi this is the one .no monsters trying to kill everyone but a good survival novel well thought out maybe a bit technical in places but that adds to the story. All in all a good read.

  I think you have to be at least a little interested in science and technology to fully enjoy the book but the jokey narrative makes it much more accessible. The best book I've read in a long time. Sad I've finished it but looking forward to the film.I imagined Watney as Matt Damon - good choice of actor, visually and voice-wise at least.

  I loved the writing style and the story was a real page-turner. I used to love sci-fi but felt that the genre had got a bit clichéd and tired for my taste, but this was refreshingly new and cleverly constructed, with plenty of real science facts in it. My only regret is that I haven't been able to find any more sci-fi novels by this author.

  I loved this book! Read it in two days, just couldn't put it down. It ticked all my boxes for what a good read constitutes, scifi, space based ( well on mars mainly) and a bit technical. The main character has a sense of humour and the book had me laughing out loud quite a few times. Suspense was really good which always keeps the reader engaged. If you're a fan of scifi and like the old back from the brink of disaster reads then I'm sure you will love this. I won't say anything specific about the book because I always feel that spoils it!

  A very entertaining credible science fiction novel. The Martian is based on a scenario where an astronaut, mark Whitney, believed killed on a Mars expedition survives but is stranded on the planet. What follows is what does Whitney do to survive and communicate with earth. The science is believable and also references old Apollo missions. It's an intelligent and highly enjoyable read.

Stranded alone on Mars and keeps a top sense of humour the whole time whilst being an absolute genius. Literally laughed out loud every few pages. Science is pretty heavy as others have stated but you don't need to fully understand the numbers as the author uses an ""explain like I'm 5"" style alongside it.

  It's best and most believable book I've read about Mars exploration, as well as being an engaging thriller that maintains its pace from start to finish. The science is both plausible and clearly explained, and I found myself rooting for the main character, while the twists added enough tension to make me want to read the book in one sitting!

Full of technical and scientific ideas and theories but wholly understandable by an ignoramus like me.  Felt I was there with Watney sharing his triumphs and anxieties when things went wrong.  A hero in a space vacuum, totally self-sufficient, and all done with great humour.  A very good read.

  The positive slant on science and engineering was refreshing and the adventures seemed based on the reality of space exploration of the near future.

  Written well enough, and with what feels like scrupulous scientific accuracy, but lacking in real drama or urgency due to the nature of the scenario. In addition, the sections following characters on Earth or on the returning ship are significantly weaker than those following the main character, and really weaken the flow of the novel.

  You get stranded on Mars. Everyone thinks you are dead.  You have no means of communication. What are you going to do now?  Read this book on recommendation. Grabs you from the first page to the last.  Do not read this book when you go to bed if you have to get up early - you will not want to put it down.

  I enjoyed this book even though wanting to throw it at the wall several times. The main character is at times unbelievable, along with his annoying monologue. What saved it for me was the exciting premise and page turning plot. Better character development, less expletive dialogue and a good editor would have improved The Martian no end.

  This is well written hard science fiction, well thought through, based on space technologies that are not too far ahead of what we could build now. If there are any problems with the science, engineering and agronomy, they were not obvious enough to grate.

  Great idea and a well paced plot. However, my question is this - why do we get to know the characters at mission control, and those on the rescue ship, better than Mark Watney himself? The book would be better titled ""The Earthlings"" as it is the people back on earth who are by far the more interesting. Will make a better film.

Apart from an amazingly written escalating drama on changing probabilities of survival, the author offers a well thought spiral of problem solving.

  This is the best book I have read for many years.

  A good Sci-Fi page turner that was pretty enjoyable from start to finish. Did have some typos and spelling mistakes throughout though.

  This is about a stranded astronaut on Mars.The story goes into considerable details about survival and the calculations he has to make to survive.It's full of set backs and his struggle to overcome.There are some glaring calculation errors and some scientific explanations and theories that don't hold water.eg - you can't chemical split water into hydrogen and oxygen without a considerable amount of energy and that's not possible with a simple solar or battery array.But its a good read and I enjoyed it.Read on the Kindle

  When I finished my last book it took me a long time to disengage with the story and this was the first book I tried that gripped my attention.  It is good but it does have several flaws.Basically, from page 1 to page end you know he's either going to survive or die.  There isn't much scope for a surprise ending.  It's all a question of how he will survive or die,It's not very satisfying to see one disaster after the other solved so quickly by pure chance and I question whether a botanist would be such an incredible engineer as well.The way he writes his log is odd.  He's a scientist but he writes like a story teller.  The other people in the book are also hard headed scientists but they don't behave like it.The biggest flaw is he doesn't describe how he feels,  Think of the 33 Chilean miners who were stranded underground for 10 weeks.  It was hottish but they had food, water a breathable atmosphere, a safe place, companionship, a leader and they were in touch with the surface after only 3 weeks.  Yet some were badly affected psychologically.  Now imagine you're on Mars and you're looking at 4 YEARS stranded alone.  One thing after another goes badly wrong.  You're out of touch with earth.  Wouldn't it start to affect you psychologically?  Wouldn't you start imagining things, wouldn't you feel really afraid?  None of this comes across in the book.The ending is very far fetched and unbelievable.

  The problem I have with this book is that it unravels... the author starts by sticking with a plausible series of crewed missions to Mars, and a single crew-member being left behind. However, it needs an editor to guide the writer to make it into the effective book-length story it could be.Without wanting to give away any spoilers, the man left on Mars is allegedly a ""botanist/mechanical engineer"" but the book ignores or makes mistakes about biology. It's still fun to read, but ends in a deeply unsatisfactory fashion, ignoring psychology.For me, the best thing about this book was the author's attempt to write a story based on a plausible Mars-landing programme, and I was willing to ignore the nonsense of the potato-farm. However, towards the end, things become too ridiculous and crash into a bad ending.This book begs for a second edition; as it is it's both very, very good and unnecessarily bad.

  I've no doubt that this book will make a wonderful film, but as a work of fiction I wasn't convinced by it and gave up in despair. For me, the novel failed in two essential ways. First, the main character was completely two-dimensional and came across as the sort of person you'd avoid talking to at parties. When he finds himself abandoned on Mars, there is none of the usual existential angst that even the most highly-trained astronaut might feel in that situation, so we have virtually no insight into what makes him tick. Second, there is very little sense of place. This might seem an absurd objection, given the fact that Mark Watney is stuck in a specific location on Mars, but Andy Weir doesn't provide the reader with a strong visual sense of what the landscape is like, or how the winds sound from inside the base.I liked the hard science to start with - it made the whole scenario feel plausible and more compelling, but the relentless accounts of how to produce X by mixing Y and Z quickly became tedious and should have been interspersed with episodes that told us something about the main character. Instead, I felt as if I was reading an educational book for young adults.Andy Weir clearly has a talent for coming up with interesting, plausible plots, backed up by his obvious passion for science, but I don't rate him as a novelist. However, I seem to be in a minority, so this must be, as someone has said, a 'marmite book'.

  The Martian is an odd book to review. I'm giving it three stars but it could be two or four, depending on what you want from a novel about an astronaut stranded on Mars. The novel does exactly what it sets out to do, the format is laid out very clearly early on, and the plot all comes together very nicely at the end.The novel tells the story of an astronaut stranded on Mars when the third science expedition to land on Mars is unexpectedly forced to return home due to dangerous weather conditions (a sandstorm) that might damage their habitat or their return vehicle. Team botanist Mark Watney is thought dead and so his fellow astronauts leave him behind. Luckily he has their habitat and equipment from the curtailed mission, plus the can-do personality to improvise with this equipment. Weir thus sets up the means for both his survival and a potential rescue.The format of the novel is, well, for want of a better description - a science lesson. Watney is confronted by a series of science problems - how to grow food, how to communicate with NASA on Earth, for example, and his first person log entries show him doing the calculations, applying the scientific principles, encountering unexpected consequences, before ultimately solving the problem. This format is repeated many times through the novel, right down to (sometimes) explaining the mathematical calculations required.The characterisation of Watney is of a broadly likeable scientist with a can-do attitude. Probably the perfect candidate for the position in real life, but I found his wisecracks, developing love for the 70s tv and disco music left behind by his colleagues, to be all surface. There was no depth to his personality - no history, no memories of family, girlfriend, old pets.The book isn't just a series of Watney's log entries. We also have narrative interludes with the NASA technicians back on Earth and the crewmates on their long return journey to Earth. There isn't much characterisation here too: each one is similarly flippant and occasionally sarcastic (though not as flippant as Watney).I'm a big fan of tales of early spaceflight, particularly the exploration of the solar system, Stephen Baxter's Voyage is a favourite hard SF guilty pleasure, even though my tastes usually run more towards the literary side of SF. The story of Watney's survival (or otherwise) is well put together and includes all of the required elements of peril, derring-do and despair. This is NASA and Earth only a few years into the future, when Martian exploration is developing in the same way that Apollo explored the moon. The technology is recognisable, with the addition of the ion drive that has powered them (and two earlier missions) to Mars.So why don't I really know if I like it? Well I enjoyed the plot and it is a convincing description of quite how dangerous and inhospitable Mars is, and Watney's wiseass personality gives the novel enough of a sense of fun that it makes for a good beach book, or other distraction.I personally found the long passages where Watney deduces a solution and then explains it to be digressive, skippable, and lacking in excitement. But then I'm a literature graduate. I'm not looking for the poetry of Martian solitude or anything like that, but equally some of the science in these digressions passes me by, and so much of it piled on top of more descriptive science seems to diminish my respect for Watney (and the author)'s inventiveness. He becomes a science _bore_ somewhere around the middle of the book and I only began to like him again as we neared the climax and there were multiple elements at stake beyond simple survival in a hostile environment.But I'm not sure I'm really the target audience for the book. I'm not anti-science or anything foolish like that, but this is clearly a book written for those who love the ingenious deduction of the Mythbusters TV show, or the Discovery channel, and there's nothing wrong with that.That isn't necessarily a complaint. What I am saying is that I am not the book's target audience, yet I enjoyed it on an aiport thriller, beach-read level. If you like the ingenuity of science, love Mythbusters and want to understand the science and logic of both the problems and the solutions necessary to survive in the ultimate hostile environment then this could be the book about Mars for you. It could stoke the love of science in kids and teenagers and it should work well for those who love the days when science fiction meant fiction about science.

I saw the latter a week ago, in 3D, and thought it was by far the best SF film I have seen since 2001: A Space Odyssey. There were a few technical goofs that were annoying, but it's a piece of thrilling fiction and you have to suspend belief.  It was well-paced, although still a bit overlong.Before discussing the book, I should mention that I am often irritated when I read technical detail from an author who has little understanding of science or who hasn't done his homework.  I remember throwing a Clive Cussler novel out of the window some time ago - and Lee Child also makes a few howlers.So I decided to read the Andy Weir book and, so far, have been pretty disappointed.  The vast amount of technical detail, often fiercely numerical, is absurd - this is supposed to be a work of entertainment, for goodness sake!  I felt that the book should really be a novella, with the brain numbingly boring technical detail removed to allow the story to flow smoothly.  Although I'm an engineer, I read a book like this to be gripped by the story, not to agree with the author on the partial pressures of gases or the laws of thermodynamics etc.  Even with all that technical burden, Weir makes a number of scientific goofs.  Mature authors, like Clarke, would have put in enough (very accrurate) technical detail to enhance the story and give it authenticity but not overload it with tedious redundant technical padding.The human side of the book, the characterisation and relationships, is weak and most of the characters, apart from the main protagonist, are two dimensional - little more than names on the page.  Several reviewers have mentioned the humour.  Well, it's there but I wouldn't read the book just for laughs.So it was great that such a well-conceived film could be made from this book, but I wouldn't recommend the book unless you enjoy wading through a morass of unnecessary technical detail.  On the other hand, the film is very watchable and the technical content was just about right for me.

  The Martian tells the story of a modern day Robinson Crusoe, an astronaut stranded on Mars after an accident leads to his crew hastily bailing on their mission and leaving him for dead.The tale of his ingenuity and endeavour as he attempts to survive and find a way, anyway to survive and try to get home is a brilliant read.  The pacing is great, I couldn't put it down, the characters engrossing and well written and the science all seems very believable to a layman like me.I'd recommend this to anyone, not just Sci-Fi fans, it's as much a thriller as anything else and a brilliant read.

  great book.there's certainly no science in here that isn't entirely realistic in 2013,  I suspect there is very little technology in it that isn't entirely feasible at this point if we had the will to do it.the start is perhaps a little cool - everything in it carefully thought through and argued out - and this matches everything I've read about NASA and spaceflight.but once this gets going it is also as exciting and compelling as any thriller- and all the more compelling because it's genuinely realistic in a way that pretty much every thriller/ action movie isn't

  Plot: On a manned mission to Mars one of the crew members [Mark Watney] is left behind after being mistaken for dead. He has to use his engineering and botany skills to survive so he can make contact with Earth and either wait for the next mission to Mars to collect him or for his colleagues to turn back and pick him up.Review: There were a lot of reviews about this book being like a cross between MacGyver and Robinson Crusoe {On Mars} and being a fan of sci-fi and of RCOM I decided to purchase it.Alas, I am going to go and against the grain of reviews on amazon and say that I thought it was 'so-so' at best. And this is why:1. Mark Watney is quite superficially drawn, I never felt I knew much about him and so subsequently I just didn't particularly care whether he survived or not. In fact I was more interested in what happened to his colleagues who seemed more interesting, well-rounded and likeable.2. The main character is not particularly likeable. [Maybe the crew stranded him on purpose?]This isn't a requisite of-course for a fictional character and I can think of many characters who are downright disagreeable but Mark Watney seems to spend a lot of his 'stream of consciousness'  blowing off his readers:e.g  ""henceforth rover missions will be Sirius....get it? Dogs? Well if you don't, f*ck you.""I know this is billed as funny and as geeky, but it struck me that he displayed the kind of anti-social tendencies they probably tried to filter out at NASA before shooting you off to Mars.3. The science is pretty dull. This is meant to be science-fiction; not science fact. I am a scientist and I like to read long descriptions of how something is done in the methodology sections of those shrink wrapped journals I subscribe to on a monthly basis, not in something supposedly designed to entertain. A long description of how to use s@!t [no, not salt... I'm gonna have to spell it out for you... s.h.i.t] on Mars for fertiliser does get a little yawn-inducing - I started calling it 'The Man from Uranus' at this point. Credit to the author; it does seem superficially to be well researched but it does rather get in the way of the story especially given the almost near total absence of....4. Emotional depth. This is a guy stranded on his own on a planet. He occasionally makes isolated remarks about really missing members of his crew, but other than stating "" I  really miss those guys"" I was completely unable to infer his emotions or to detect any sense of his isolation, or of his psychology beginning to fray.  I personally thought this was an omission and one which has been addressed in more depth in movies like ""Moon"" and ""I am legend"" [the latter is not about space, but it is about being alone.]5. Where all the aliens? ..... I'm joking! Oh you don't get it? Really? Then **** you! ...can you now see why Mark Watney is so annoying? [see point 2 above].Other than all that, the story is a neat idea and a lot of people clearly love the book, so what do I know? If it looks like you'll enjoy it, go ahead and buy it, it won't cost you the Moon, or Mars. Alternatively go and buy 'The Martian Chronicles' and discover Bradbury.There is a short story at the end of the book which is kind of a prologue and which could have done with being an actual prologue as it goes a little of the way to explaining why the crew act the way they do so you may want to consider reading that first.If you want more of a flavour for what you are letting yourself in for, please read on.....A review in the style of Watney (the astronaut)Oh man! I picked this book up and realised I had forty eight hours left to return it, before the library began to charge me late fees. Forty eight hours! that's two days, or 0.06 months (assuming a 30 day month). So I took it everywhere with me in order to get it finished, this was easy to do due to the fact that the character is so damn compelling. I even took The Martian to the toilet and almost confused some of the pages with toilet paper. Haha gad zooks that would have been funny, The Martian used to wipe Uranus. Crickey see what I just did there? The Martian? Uranus? Your anus? No? Then F*** you!Anyway, I ploughed through the macgyveresque descriptions at 1page every 5 minutes (that's 300 seconds). After a while my finger acquired a paper cut and so lacking a plaster I used my improv skills and made a band-aid out of pared down a4 paper and Sellotape. This is a neat trick if you get paper cuts, here let me tell you how to do it.Firstly, drone drone drone drone drone drone drone f=Ma, coefficient of resistance, drone drone drone drone, and la voila the perfect band aid! I then realised I had two hours on the clock before the library closed. Jeez I thought, this could be doom. I was really nervous man. I could tell how nervous I was because, well I'm not sure, but I was reaaaaaly nervous. So I speeded things up a bit by skimming segments. Another disaster averted by cunning ingenuity.Finally, I was finished, but there were only 15 minutes left on the clock. I rushed to the car but realised that damn!!! The car was locked with the keys in the ignition. Oh Maaaaaan! I scratched my head and realised that by planting my ass on the saddle of a bike and peddling the pedals at an optimal velocity of 120 revolutions per minute I could get down to the library in time.And I did.Oh the book was good too.

  Read this at a friends recommendation. Wasn't particularly expectant but as it turns out this is for the most part a very well written story. Almost a documentary style of writing, most of the book is written as a ""log"" from the main character, telling posterity about his struggles. Very engaging and technically interesting.It was let down by the ending as so many books are, hours of reading the struggles and strife to end it all in 20-30 pages of not particularly dramatic events. However the conclusion is mildly satisfying.Thoroughly worth a read.

  I read The Martian about a year after it had hit mainstream awareness, but before the announcement it would be made into a Hollywood film. I’m glad that I’d managed to avoid the hype around this novel as it meant I could enjoy it without any preconceived notion of what to expect.On the first manned mission to Mars, a devastating sandstorm threatens to destroy the habitat set up by the the first astronauts to land there. They decide to evacuate, but during the evac astronaut Mark Watney is hit by a broken communications antenna. Believing Mark to be dead, the crew continue their evac and start their journey back to Earth, their mission to Mars terminated.Waking from unconsciousness, Watney realises that he’s been left behind. His suit was torn during the storm, but congealed blood from his wounds had sealed the tear. Now he must somehow survive using supplies left behind. And then he must contact Earth to try and get help and hopefully, eventually: rescue.Watney is an engineer and a botanist. His scientific knowledge is the only thing that is going to help him survive. He knows he is screwed and that his chances are slim, but he doesn’t let that get in the way. First he must find a way to create water and food. Water is made from unused hydrazine rocket fuel, while food comes from planting potatoes in Martian soil mixed with his own stool. This is how most of the book follows: a problem must be solved and Watney uses his knowledge and skills to solve it and survive a little longer. Watney keeps a log of his endeavours, thinking that he will never be rescued, so that at least when NASA returns in four years they will know what happened.When NASA observe the fruits of Watney’s work, they realise he’s alive and try to find a way to communicate with him. Watney believes his only chance for survival is to travel 2000 miles in a rover buggy to the location of the next manned mission landing in the hope he’ll be rescued in four years.There’s a lot of science in this book, and it’s mostly believable and interesting. Indeed, the “doing science” aspect of the novel has been roundly praised for it’s accuracy. But the problem-solution cycle bogs down the human story with unnecessary nerdery and it makes the story drag. I believe that the science in sci-fi should be a skeleton on which to build a human story, not the story itself.And what about the characters? Well, there wasn’t much to get involved with. Watney’s character is pragmatic and cocky. He doesn’t dwell on existential matters. There’s almost no self-reflection that I could relate to. The secondary characters — all those at NASA and the crew that left him behind — are very pale impressions of stereotypes I’ve encountered a hundred times before. I can’t remember much about them at all.Despite the lack of good supporting characters, the heart of this story is strong and I rooted for Watney’s survival. But while it’s an entertaining read, The Martian spends too long on the science and not nearly enough time on the soul.

  Searching for something to read, I happened upon this. Saw the high star rating and a note saying it was about to be removed from Kindle because Andy Weir had secured a book deal: why not I thought. Why not indeed? I'm 30% of the way through and I had to stop to rate it.It's a page flicker (Turner)  The story is about an astronaut who gets stranded on Mars after a mission goes wrong and what he has to do to survive. I have no idea how it will end, I hope in the way I want it to, I've 70% more of the book to go, but it doesn't matter. It's well written, real and full of humanity.

  It was fast paced and interesting to read. Lots of detail about the issues our hero confronted and how he overcame them. Deriving and implementing the solution for the rendezvous with the rescue team in the time available was too much of a stretch for me. One thing that doesn't fit with Mars data is the original problem was caused by high speed winds knocking over the antenna and causing him to go tumbling. The Martian atmosphere is very low density and is about 1% of Earth atmospheric pressure. Even 150 kmh wind speeds just wouldn't have the energy to do that. But nevertheless I enjoyed the book and hope the author continues to write similar material.

  I found this book by chance but what a find.  Although I am a fan of lengthy 'space opera' I enjoyed the fast pace and focus of The Martian.  It is a strong story with the main characters developed just enough to care but without being buried in detail.  The story zips along on the edge and it's hard to put down not knowing what will happen next.  I was sorry to finish it and look forward to more from Andy Weir.

  A great story, cross between Apollo 13 and Gravity, definitely movie material. Nearly gave it 5 stars as it was very gripping and a good read. The one minus for me was the main character is rather one dimensional. Although I grew to like him, and the humour had me crack a smile a few times, I felt the need to write in some prose of my own. Perfect setting for philosophical arguments in his head, for looking out at the stars and wondering which dot may actually be his home planet. Mars must have some beauty about it, even if only the setting sun, or a view of its two moons, anything! And surely his situation would make him cycle through a plethora of human emotions - anger, sadness, downright depression, bitterness, hope, misery, despair, acceptance, fear, loneliness, cycling round with some good days in between? Instead he seemed mostly to crack jokes or swear at things!Still, I would highly recommend this book, and if you don't understand the science, ignore it.....the story is good enough to please engineers and sci fi fans alike. Enjoy.

  I didn't realise this was going to be Robinson Crusoe in space. Daniel Defoe would have had shivers reading this version of his story though.As a young boy, Robinson Crusoe sets you up with al the techniques you'll ever need if you should find yourself stranded on a desert island (certainly no need to make friends with Wilson).Watney needed a Wilson or, better still, a spaceman Friday (Wilson would have exploded I suppose). Anyone to give him a vital distraction to his surely morbid and depressing existence. This guy was definitely born on the 13th day of the 13th month. If it could go wrong, it did. And that did not make a pleasant read.I found I soon learned a lot about making oxygen from hydrazine and s*** on your spuds. If I ever find myself stuck on a strange planet, I'll be sure to thank Andy Weir in my dull as dishwater journal.I treated this book like Watney treated survival on Mars - tackle each problem with a stoicism and a strong will power and keep plodding on.I feel a little sorry for all those people that raved over this book - they must get few visitors to their institutions and are short of stimulus.

  Didn't live up to the hype for me, not terribly good but not terribly bad either.This book has a great premise but fails to follow through on many levels. I'll start off by saying the overly technical descriptions and calculations didn't actually bother me too much, that's a stylistic choice I can live with although I can easily see how it would irritate a lot of readers so it was a risky choice by the author.The biggest issue I had with this book was the shallowness of the characters. The group of NASA scientists were very hard to distinguish because they had such indistinct personalities so it was hard to keep track of who was who for a while. Watney himself is a fairly unconvincing character as well. His sense of humour didn't resonate with me at all and I found it hard to imagine that someone with what is best described as a childish and light-hearted-to-a-fault mentality could become an astronaut. It got to a point where his actions weren't in sync with his thoughts. He is incredibly resourceful, sometimes finding solutions where the combined minds of NASA failed but when he is talking to us he sounds like that annoying friend everyone could do without. I just found it hard to believe the person finding ingenious solutions to problems within a day of encountering the problem was the same person cracking childish jokes all the time.Some minor spoilers follow.The sense of drama by the end of the book was completely shot. I always find it poor when you can see the ending a mile off and in The Martian it was quite obvious what way things were headed. But even within the story there was never any tension. Watney solves his problems so quickly and efficiently that when things arise like blown airlocks and sandstorms there is no sense that things could go wrong, you know everything will be fine and that's a huge letdown in any book. Asides from that, the fact that Watney suffers absolutely no psychological damage from spending so long stranded on a different planet took away from the book as a whole. I'm not saying it needed to be dark and gritty, but Watney's head never drops once despite the myriad of problems arising precisely in time to inconvenience him. A two week period where his logs are downhearted and he refuses to work or communicate with NASA would have just given it a little touch towards a more realistic account of isolation but perhaps Mark is also aware of his virtual invincibility as the readers are.The Martian is not a terrible book, it's a decent story rather poorly executed. If you are into space then you will probably enjoy it and if you don't mind the technical jargon and mathematics then you will enjoy it more. But it's not a book to stick in your mind long after reading it.

  Or make that the first and potentially last physics book I've ever and will ever read cause I don't think physics book tend to be this laugh out loud funny.  Let me make it clear that I did not understand any of the science which makes up 95% of this book! I tried to keep up but the last bit of math I enjoyed was Algebra a million years ago and I gave up Science after Chemistry. My lack of understanding did not impact on my enjoyment of this book in the least.I'll explain. As a science fiction fan I buy into the geek stuff but it's been tiresome of late trudging through some of the offerings. They start out promising then before you know it you're ploughing through a field of unadulterated tripe (ahem Chris Beckett's Marcher). Mark Watney is a Huck Finn for this age. I rooted for him along with the rest of humanity. That's what so great about this book forget the science, this thoroughly likable botanist/engineer caught my heart and all the tension in the book was derived from whether my new geeky (he played Dungeons and Dragons in high school for Pete's sake) boyfriend was going to make it off of Mars and escape his forced reliving of 70s music and TV. I even loved the cast of characters whose moments on stage were unforgettable. NASA nerds whose social skills were clearly arrested but they also had some of the funniest lines in the book. Weir loses half a point for the caricature that is PR woman Annie. On behalf of PR women everywhere Jesus frickin' Christ we're not all ballsy loudmouths. Enough already.

  This novel was originally an online hit in serialised form on Weir's own blog, which became so overwhelmingly popular that he decided to self-publish it as an e-book on Amazon. It soon attracted enough buzz for a publisher to pick it up, which generated even more rabid success. In a sense, this gungho DIY spirit is mirrored in Weir's protagonist, astronaut Mark Watney, as the story finds him stranded on Mars after being left for dead in an accident by his crewmates.The journal entries which make up the bulk of the narrative read well in episodic form, and it is clear Weir knows his subject matter, as he traces Watney's fight for survival with mind-boggling scientific facts that he takes pains to make comprehensible to the average layman reader. That Watney is instantly likeable as a resourceful everyday man, who recounts his days (or sols) on Mars with wit and candour, is both the novel's strength and weakness. It makes it easy for the reader to root for him, but at the same time, there is very little psychological depth apparent in the character, which perhaps, isn't the business of this novel. Watney treats each obstacle that comes his way at heartstopping moments with increasingly predictable levity, while retaining the goofy and good-natured ""oh, heck it"" attitude of a college frat bro. There is surprisingly very little mention of his ties with people back on Earth, which makes possible his being a very present-minded individual. Even his crewmates get more development as individuals under their spacesuits, even though this is purposefully done in a segment when they converse with their loved ones from outer space.That said, Weir paces the action well, and allows Watney's journal entries to speak for themselves, interspersed with the goings-on at NASA, as they scramble to come up with a rescue plan. Weir only comes in as an omniscient narrator at a few critical junctures, when the reader needs to know some crucial facts to get a better sense of the situation.This is a novel that a reader plunges in already knowing the ending, but that does not detract from the enjoyment of anticipating the 'hows' that ending entails.

  Who'd have thought so many people would rave about reading endless engineering detail?Precisely how many holes did you have to drill? And how long, exactly, did that take? Tell me again how you stacked those solar panels? Describe, in precise detail, the tests you carried out to ensure that your repair was functional? And wow, that glue sure comes in handy, doesn't it?It's all here. The first-person narrator of this story just can't help but tell you this stuff, sometimes dictating the detail into his audio log while under quite hectic time pressure. I'm usually a fan of scientific detail in SF, but the detail in this one just introduces too many longueurs into what could have been a much pacier and more gripping account. Andy Weir obviously spent a lot of time thinking about the science, but he should have throttled back a little on including it all in the story: ""show, don't tell"" is a timeworn but useful maxim.There are also errors in the science, which is a bit of a killer if you're going to inflict all your calculations on the reader. One hundred percent oxygen is not as dangerous as Weir makes out. One percent oxygen, on the other hand, is much *more* dangerous to breathe than Weir makes out - it kills you a lot faster than just holding your breath would do. Medical oxygen masks don't work the way Weir implies. And for a while the protagonist is double-counting his expired carbon dioxide, using it to generate oxygen *and* to grow potatoes.- he can't successfully do both simultaneously. In a standard SF offering, these problems would induce no more than a shrug and an eye-roll, but when Weir keeps shoving the detail down the reader's throat, this reader tends to rebel.We also could have done with a slightly more restricted narrative style. There's a first-person narrative, a third-person narrative with a multitude of POV characters (including the narrator of the first-person narrative) and an omniscient observer who occasionally steps in to update us on the some of the techy detail unknown to any of the characters. It adds clunkiness that this novel can ill afford.What was good? Lots of things were good. The lead character is engaging - unlike some negative reviewers, I don't find either his levity or his profanity out of place. If you hang around with people who deal with life-or-death situations, the tone will ring true.There are gripping moments, and I'm glad I ploughed through the endless detail to get to them, because they are tense and well written. If the whole book had been written in the style of the final few pages, it would have been utterly compelling. There are some ingenious plot elements. And there are good touches of humour - I smiled at some of the revealing dialogue between the minor characters.As I hope this review shows, I came away from this one feeling more frustrated than disappointed. I'll keep an eye out for more from Andy Weir in future.

  This is a tense novel set in the near future about astronaut Mark Watney's survival on Mars after he is accidentally left for dead after a mission failure.  Using the resources at his disposal and his own ingenuity, he is able to stretch his resources and overcome numerous technological and physical problems, largely on his own, though with occasional ad hoc communication with NASA.  Various plans are put in place to rescue and/or supply him with additional food until another Mars probe can come along to his rescue.  Filled with (sometimes excessive) technical description, this also has many moments of great tension and drama and a feeling of ""how will he get out of this one?"".  Very good, though the secondary characters come across as very one dimensional.

  This book tells the story of Mark Watney who is left behind on Mars when his crewmates think he is dead and they believe they have to leave Mars for their own safety. It turns out they were wrong and Mark didn't die in the accident, and this is then the story of his attempt to survive alone on a planet with very limited resources.Mark is a very intelligent, resourceful and determined man. He is also funny, irreverent, and very likeable.Although this is essentially his story, the other people in this book are also well written and rounded characters; and we get an insight into the crew, the ground staff and the workings of NASA. This book also highlights the resilience, or perhaps stubborn persistence, of scientists, engineers, astronauts, and others working in the space programme.I don't know if the science stuff is ""real"" - but it doesn't matter because it comes across as very realisitic and seems real. The story is not too science-y but nor does it shy away from this and the reader is treated as a reasonably intellligent human being, and it doesn't feel dumbed down.It isn't the science though that makes this book so good, but the depiction of man overcoming diversity, in extreme situations. Not just the main character but several others, whose lives are changed by this situation. It was well paced and easy to read and really gripped me so I found it difficut to put down.This is now one of my favourite books.

  The third Mars mission has had to evacuate and return home because of a dangerously strong storm. Due to a freak accident, Mark Watney is left for dead. But he’s not dead. And now he’s alone on Mars, without enough food, air, or energy to last the many months it would take rescue to arrive. Not that he can call for help. Nevertheless, he is an engineer…This is a great adventure of engineer versus planet, in the old tradition: Apollo 13 meets Gravity meets A Fall of Moondust.Watney is competent and resourceful, and he does have resources to be resourceful with: all the equipment the crew left behind when they abandoned Mars. Mars keeps throwing problems at him, and he keeps figuring out solutions, knowing that the first problem he can't solve will kill him for sure.What makes this fun is all the engineering (although I’m sure it’s much harder than shown here); the little acid comments Watney keeps making about the entertainment choices of his departed crewmates; and the potatoes.I am surprised that Watney didn’t realise that Earth would be able to see that he was still alive, but much of the rest of it rings sufficiently true to make this a thrilling adventure across the Red Planet.

  I bought this after seeing the film (which was great by the way).  But, in spite of knowing what was going to happen, I found the book a real page-turner.  I expected to find the narrator's voice to irritate me after a while, but it didn't, although it was good to get a break from it and find out what was going on at NASA (which didn't appear until well into the book.)  There's a lot more going on in the book than was portrayed in the film, some of it pretty dramatic.  The only quibbles I have are that the protagonist seemed to be supernatural in his ability to fix stuff, even for a tech geek, and that the ending in the book was a little weaker than the film.  Still, five stars or more.

  Before making a purchase I always read the reviews and often they tip the final 'buy or not buy' decision, especially for new authors.For this book most reviews were by far positive ones, so what I'm about to write must reflect a minority opinion but I'm disappointed enough to carry on and make a negative comment regardless. The concept is excellent. The execution is absolutely diabolical. The diary format unimaginative, the quality of writing awful. Would a highly educated, highly motivated individual have only the eloquence of sixth form student writing up his end of term science project ? This was a wonderful opportunity to explore  emotions, thoughts, feelings. Laying truely, awfully alone, abandoned, frightened, listening to the wind. And what of Mars. Where are the skies, the stars, the sand ? Are both moons visible ? What does sunset look like?  Perhaps I've read too much Bradbury. The whole story is hugely one dimensional and I'm sorry to say, hugely boring.

  There's no doubt it's a thrilling read. It's very well written and makes the reader feel at the heart of the action, which is a sign of good writing. There's 'edge of seat' tension recurring all the way through as the ending could go either way, causing it to be a genuine page-turner. For a first novel, and one that was initially self-published it is a phenomenal achievement. The story is gripping, extremely well researched, and highly believable. That's the good stuff.For me personally there was too much maths. I'm not a fan of calculations and after a while you know when the hero has a problem it will inevitably be followed by lots of exhaustive calculations. I'm sure they are all probably correct, we have to take the author's word on it, but do we need quite so many?  'I worked out how much I would need and I had just enough'  Surely that's better than lots and lots of figures? By page 300 I was beginning to find this a little boring, predictable, and repetitive. The book could have been shorter than 369 pages and been just as good if not better. There were so many 'I tried this and it worked, I wondered how long it would last so I tried this instead and that worked so I then tried the other...' etc. etc.  I know it's a book about survival but sometimes I felt we were going on a re-tread with the author creating hurdles much of the time in order to pad out the book, when as I said, it could have been speeded up a little. But that's just my opinion of course. I also felt there wasn't enough desperation; I know astronauts are meant to be hard, the 'right stuff' as they say, but the character had been abandoned on Mars, with no apparent hope of rescue. There were no tears or screaming in desperation, just a lot of swearing instead. It came across as though he was merely stranded on a desert island rather than on a dangerous hostile planet. 'I'm trapped here. Oh well, never mind, I think I'll grow some potatoes '.I took a look at the film version but to be honest I couldn't be bothered watching it. I knew what was going to happen - obviously -  and couldn't be bothered with all the calculations and 'so I tried this and it worked so I then tried that and it was great for a while so I then tried this and that and this...'.Sorry.

  Very enjoyable read and an interesting premise. Persevere beyond the GCSE maths fest that constitutes the first section because fortunately the rest of the book moves on to an actual plot rather than a series of equations. Did feel in retrospect that we don't actually get to know much about our hero beyond his problem solving skills - think most humans in such a situation might display a greater range of emotions, nostalgia etc. But then I am guilty of contemplating the deep fragility of life every time I board easyjet to Bristol.

  Incredibly entertaining. The Martian was a joy to read its a good sci fi story in that its believable and not what many sci fi books involve which is far flung corners of unknown space with weird creatures and quasi science, with copious amounts of things to remember. The martian tells the story of a NASA astronaut left abandoned on the planet after an premature abortion of a mission there. I guess the story is enjoyable in that you genuinely care for the man stuck there (mark watney) and the amount of peril he is in and the sheer garvity of his situation puts you on the edge of your seat. However the story is not bleak this guy is extremely resourceful (he is a nasa astronaut) but more than that he has the necessary skills as a botanist and engineer to scrape a survival and escape plan to get his bottom off the planet alive. Be warned however if you want a book with 'space fantasy' this book is not for you.  Its gritty and down to earth (or mars) but like I said before it is not bleak in fact many parts are really quite funny. Its so enjoyable it should be made into a film with the comedic elements very much a part of it, without that it would be rubbish.

  Not a bad book, really good in places.The plot is a bit like Apollo 13 on Mars. An astronaut is stranded on Mars and has to figure out how to survive, to communicate and to maybe get rescued.I found the early parts of the book engrossing because of this tension. About half-way through I got a bit bored as there are *lots* of very technical descriptions of solving various problems. Tension ramps up again toward the end as you might expect. So overall it was enjoyable.

  Pros - Mark Watney is one of the best main characters I have ever come across - he's not in any way your normal hero, but if you're a nerd, he may become your new god - Entertaining and witty writing style and content - the ability to shift between the dramatic and the wry was particularly amazing - String scientific content - mostly cut from the film, there is an awful lot of science in the book, which makes it different and informative - The shifts in narrative and perspective (between characters and between first person logs/third person narration) are very well placed and editedCons - As much as I loved the science, it did make it difficult to read the Martian before bed.  My brains just not that good when tired - The long gaps between some logs (most of the story is told by logs made by Mark) was a bit incongruous.  This was a simple trick to skip between periods of action, but felt forced and also missed a strong opportunity to explore the character and the psychological impacts of what he was going through - The biggest weakness was the failure to get further into the psychology of Mark Watney, who seemed to have subhuman powers of mental strength in the face of what must have been hell.  This is the one thing I felt the film did a lot better, showing a more fallible, emotive and, near the end, skeletal starved, Mark Watney.

  Life on MarsFollowing David Bowie's death, I read the latest tale of Life on Mars, that of Mark Watney, stranded and alone, fighting to survive. My copy had Matt Damon on the cover, and it was difficult not to read this as an overlong screenplay, full of wisecracks and progressive complication, like a typical Matt Damon film. It is written in immediate prose, not too subtle, mixing Watney's Mars diary with the bland mission control stuff and the slightly less bad Hermes crew, lead by the typical female commander and her now four crew, who rescue our intrepid hero.It is a science lesson, the longest I've ever read and veers between compelling thriller and Mr. Wizard. It is lots more credible than the awful and overpraised Gravity and I expect I'll enjoy the film more than the book, simply because I found the complications too much. Trim 100 pages off, and write a tad more seriously and this would be a cracking read. But as it is, it is a geek fest and ultimately, predictable. Did any reader believe Watney or the crew, would die? No way, hence, no threat.The lesson of any thriller is that the threat to the leading characters is real and not so concocted.Enjoyable up to a point, and by the way, I thank God every day I never went into space for any reason. A fate worse than bungee jumping.

  I am a dedicated SciFi fan but tend to enjoy far future works; with a little leaning towards Space Opera, the likes of modern day authors, Asher, Reynolds, Meaney and of course Banks (RIP), plus the staples Asimov, Herbert, Heinlen etc. Never been a great fan of near future stuff but came across this browsing Amazon, noticed the positive reviews and downloaded the sample. Generally with new authors I can sense pretty quickly if I am going to enjoy their style and storytelling and think the option to try a couple of chapters is excellent as often reviews can mislead. Within the first page I was hooked and really enjoyed this book, clever simple concept, wonderful detail without overdoing it and great use of humour and thoroughly believable tech and scenarios. If I had one niggle it does become a little over the top at the end; what disaster can the author dream up next to challenge everyone, but that being said well worth the read as it works on may levels and not just for SciFi fans but worth a read for any lover of a well written, taut story.

  I confess I read this because I loved the idea of it, and I'm excited for the upcoming film. With that in mind, this should be read with the full knowledge that it was a self published book first.The Martian is fun and compelling, but it's not particularly well written. The main character, Watney, has the obnoxious comedy of a redditer, and we're told he's very charming but given no evidence of it in the text. Bearing with the character for most of the book might be a bit of a struggle for some, especially when the characters you meet in the third person are each a cardboard cutout from the typical action movie. There are action movie beats sprinkled liberally throughout the narrative, such as the 'he's going for Pathfinder' scene in Houston, so if that sort of thing sticks in your craw I wouldn't go for it.While the Martian has been praised for its hard science, it has a couple of misses on psychological sciences and biology - Watney doesn't suffer nearly enough for my liking, and I would have loved to see a more detailed study of being isolated on Mars.But don't let me put you off, it's very fun and enjoyable. Definitely give it a shot if you're a sci fi fan.

  Good idea, but let down by extremely thin characterisation.At no point does the main character - abandoned alone and to certain doom on a planet a million miles from human-kind without any obvious means to communicate with anyone or immediate food source - give any indication that he might be afraid/angry/worried/or the slightest bit introspective about his situation. Or in fact any description of his Martian surroundings or what it might feel like to live on another planet.Instead he makes high-school wisecracks and watches 70 TV shows.Nice maths though

  Some Spoilers.On the face of it, The Martian is a very simple book to write. Firstly, Andy Weir’s concept is a compelling one and history has shown us it was always going to appeal to audiences – a single man, alone and facing extreme adversity, and fighting for his survival, is one which seizes attention. Couple that with the landscape of that adversity being Mars – where the three most important features of our existence are missing, oxygen, water and food – and we know immediately, his time there is limited. There is a clock running and the suspense is building. Once you have that concept, the hard work is seemingly already done.Additionally, the tone is conversational – an educated man explaining events to friends. It reminded me of Andy McNab’s Bravo Two Zero crossed with Andy Cave’s Learning to Breathe. The act of writing the book, stringing together the sentences and pouring through the pages, cannot have been a tricky task for Weir as I know he spent three years researching his topic. It shows. It's why this book is so utterly compelling – it's real. We're there. We're next to Watney, as terrified as he is – that slow-burn terror of an inexorable death that drifts in slowly from eh horizon.Yet, the reality is the task facing Weir was far more difficult. He solved the problem of creating his narrative voice through a device which is not particularly inspired – a ship’s log – but is nevertheless clever for two reasons. Firstly, it allows Weir a simple narrative voice, that of his protagonist, and the ability to see into his mind clearly. We identify with him completely and quickly. We are with him. We want him to survive. We are him. Secondly, we don’t know, from the outset, if he survives. The log is a permanent record and remains whether he survives or not. So, uninspired? Or simply taking advantage of the most effective way to tell his story? Does it matter – Weir uses a device which works.And he uses it to great effect.Initially, the POV shift to third person NASA took the story in a direction I was unhappy about – the strength of this book was Watley's narration and our insight into his character through his thought processes. His humour came through, his unwillingness to give in. Segueing to the third person from the first person is a technique I find contrived and disconcerting – if I am viewing events through the eyes of a (first person) non-omniscient narrator, to then see them through the eyes of an omniscient narrator in the third person simply does not work. Additionally, I was not convinced the story needed it, but the reality is it does build tension and it gives us a much-needed break from the sometimes too technical ""this-is-what-I-did-next"" Watley (nice as he is). So, I am willing to forgive the first-person/third-person contrivance because it drives the story nicely and I genuinely don't think Weir could have achieved what he did achieve – narrative flow and strong tension – any other way in the context of the story he was telling and the way he was telling it.Characterisation of Watney is excellent – we believe him from the very first moments. ""I'm pretty much f*****. That's my considered opinion."" In those eight words, we are told everything we need to know about Watney's personality. The subtle dig within the words ""considered opinion"" suggested his expertise and what he now thinks of it. We immediately know he's in trouble. We are compelled to read on, we simply cannot but read on. ""I don't even know who'll read this. I guess someone will find it eventually. Maybe a hundred years from now."" First person convention blown – we don't know if he's getting out of this. We see this log, and his scattered, dried bones beside them, being handled by astronauts years, even decades from now. All bets are off. This is serious. This is Into the Wild.The technical aspects of the story are integral to suspension of disbelief. Wanted (and so Weir) has to explain it to us because this is a story about fumbling for the final threads on frayed fabric, and somehow painstakingly sewing them into an escape plan. Every single thing Watney does needs scientific explanation otherwise the drama of his escape evaporates. Yet Weir manages to convey this in Watney's engaging, conversational tone so we don't despair at the detail. We love it. The quote I began this review with is the most telling example of the entire book: ""Yes, of course duct tape works in a near-vacuum. Duct tape works anywhere. Duct tape is magic and should be worshiped."" So simple, so obvious, so much said in the sort of tone which implies 'What, you didn't know that?'The Martian has won all sorts of awards and plaudits and Matt Damon is set to play Watney. Ridley Scott famously doodled on his script, demonstrating just how captured his imagination has been by this brilliant book. It's a book we need, just like Interstellar was a film we needed. Something to persuade us that there is life beyond the confines of this one planet – that we can make it to the stars and beyond and that our seemingly petty differences pale in comparison to the vastness of the possibilities which lay in wait for us. Just as Robinson Crusoe captured the public's attention, so too will The Martian.

  What a fantastic book.  This has gone straight into my list of books that I quote when thinking of my favourite books ever.  It’s a bit like a cross between the Tom Hanks film “Castaway” and the Sandra Bullock film “Gravity”, both of which are great stories in their own right.  This book follows the efforts of Mark Watney, an astronaut left stranded on the planet Mars.  Using his own inventiveness, botany knowledge and engineering skills he refuses to just give in and die.  Along with some help from NASA a rescue mission is planned.Normally I don’t go for scientific fiction but this looked intriguing. I had read that the science parts were based on science fact, and that the story, whilst being fictional, was believable due to the amount of research and knowledge that had gone into writing it.  And it was all true.  The author must be an incredibly clever man as the detail in the techy stuff is phenomenal.  It didn’t ever get boring by being too clever for its own good though.  Science fiction often becomes too bogged down with fiddly or complex detail for my liking whereas this book was never anything less than fascinating.It also has its fair share of humour too.  Mark Watney’s mission log entries are often funny and he doesn’t depress the reader by becoming a depressed, miserable so and so.Within the first third of the book I had decided that this would make a good film if done correctly.  It just so happens that one is being made with Matt Damon in the lead role.  Hopefully they do it justice but I can’t see how it could be better than the book in any way.  Amazing.

Many aspects just aren't believable, there are a series of minor plot flaws that left me thinking ""why would you do that?"" especially in one particular situation where the character has access to multiple space suits and instead of following common sense opts to make a bad decision that obviously comes back later to be a minor issue. It took me two attempts at starting this book before I could get past the dialogue and style of writing from a supposed astronaut, it's just not believable.

  A friend of mine suggested I listen to the audiobook of The Martian. So I did. I abandoned it at around 75%, once I'd confirmed the book ended as it seemed obvious it would.I frequently zoned out whilst listening. Whilst I was impressed by the technical know-how that underpins the tale, I was expecting something a little more literary.Ultimately The Martian is just a repetitive cycle of problems or disasters followed by technically complicated if improbable solutions. Beyond that there's nothing. No inner life. No insights. No descriptions of Mars. Just problem/scientific solution/problem/scientific solution etc. which quickly got boring. Fine if you like that sort of thing, and clearly millions do, but I was expecting a lot more.2/5

  This is a brilliant book.  It will appeal to anyone who enjoys a page-turning thriller, yet has the best elements of Robinson Crusoe, Apollo 13, How to be an Astronaut, and a Bear Grylls adventure.  Don't be put off if you don't read Science Fiction - Andy Weir has the knack of including real science in a way that just makes the adventure even more enjoyable.  One of the most satisfying reads for a very long time.

  I was so looking forward to reading this book which has such a fabulous first line.  I thought: ""Any book with such a great first line, must be fantastic"".  Sadly, where this book falls down is the other 40,000 or so other lines which make up the rest of the book.The premise is as follows: during a NASA mission to Mars, a storm blows up leading to the crew abandoning their mission - and - unbeknownst to them - abandoning their crewmate too, who they believe to be dead.  What follows is Mark Watney's space log as he tries to survive Mars fighting against starvation, etc, and attempting to formulate a plan to get rescued.The diary part of the book (the early part) is good - Mark Watney is a very engaging character.  However, it's completely obvious to even the biggest science class failure (I include myself in this) that he can't be rescued without NASA's help.  So the narrative has to switch to be seen from NASA's perspective - and when this happens, the book becomes a whole lot less engaging.  In fact, the narrative switches multiple times throughout the text - including having sections which relate the natural history of Mars.  In my opinion, this leads to an inconsistent narrative which spoils the story.  However, the story was also spoiled for me by the prevalent patriotic attitude perpetrated throughout the text.  This is a book which is all about how great America is and how the Americans are going to save the God-damn day.  As this trickles through the text, it becomes obvious that there really is only one ending for Mark Watney - that he is going to be saved somehow and against all the odds - because if he isn't, the book becomes anti-patriotic - and that's not what this is about.  It was sadly disappointing in a novel which I picked up to read for a great adventure story, to realise that what I was actually reading was an object lesson in pro-American propaganda.This book wasn't for me - not just for the reasons stated above - I'm more of an arts and humanities person myself and this book is too scientific for me.  Great swathes of the text are dedicated to scientific reasoning and explanations which I didn't get when I was doing my GCSE's and I still don't get now.  Disappointing.  Great first line though.

  American astronaut, Mark Watney, is in serious trouble.  All alone.  Stranded on Mars.  Presumed dead.  No incoming or outgoing communication equipment.  Survival and hope is all he has.What ensues is one man's story of courage, endurance, intelligence, combined with a great sense of humour while staring adversity full in the face.With the remaining food supplies in his space hub, Mark carefully calculates how many days he can last on the surface of Mars.  Through an ingenious experiment he significantly expands his food rations.Another main concern is how long can the life support systems in the hub maintain their integrity...If Mark could only make communicational contact with either his crews mother ship or Earth to inform them he's alive.Mark has one mission now.  He doesn't know if he'll succeed.  He may die trying.  All he knows is, somehow, he's got to get off this god forsaken planet!Written in the form of a log, Mark's style makes it appear as if he's writing directly to you, which gives the impression this is one of the ways he's sustaining his sanity.  It makes for a very personal and intimate read.Mark is a botanist and engineer, which comes in very handy in terms of his survival rate.His diligence and intelligence serve him well in what can only be a despairing situation.When he has an idea of how he can bide himself extra time, he explains the workings behind it down to the finest detail.  I did feel at times like I was being given a chemistry lesson, but to be fair to Mark he writes in layman's terms and in no way sounds condescending.  However, chemistry was never my forte so it all went over my head.  I found myself thinking ""Ok Mark.  If you say so.""  It still makes for fascinating reading.  And even he admits, he's not 100% sure of what he's doing.I found Mark to be an extremely likeable character.  He maintains his sense of humour even in dire circumstances and never seems to mentally suffer from any despondency.  Right from the get go I was rooting for him.  If I'd have been in his situation, I'd have gone insane!All in all I found this to be an excellent novel, depicting what can be achieved from the power of the human spirit.  You don't have to be a Sci-Fi fan to enjoy this as it's primarily a story of strength of character, self-belief and hope.If you're a fan of the human condition I'd highly recommend THE MARTIAN.I believe the movie adaptation is to be released in November 2015.

  Non-technical people will not understand or be interested in much of the technical descriptions of how he fixes problems on Mars. The other main problem for me was that there is too much of the technical descriptions. When well into the book I started to skip a few chapters so as to see how the story was progressing, I had heard enough of the DIY engineering. There is a lot of apparent knowledge of spacecraft design and NASA organisation.

  I was, for some reason, expecting this to be a lengthy treatise on existentialism, what with it being a novel about an astronaut stranded on Mars. It is, however, an exciting, dramatic thriller, filled with tension, dark humour and a narrative that fairly rips along.

  It's a bit bonkers, but I couldn't put it down. Our intrepid astronaut survives crisis after crisis, engineering his way out of everything with seemingly superhuman intelligence and impossible luck. It simply has too many unlikely survivals to stand up as a plot, but it is readable, addictive and a great story.If you can suspend your critical facilities, then it's very enjoyable.

  It starts off well with a charming character stranded on Mars, but his attempts to survive are all explained through hard science, and it reads to me something like this ""I should have known this would happen because long boring scientific explanation"". Paragraph after paragraph! I guess I was hoping for something more approachable, more emotional, and something more sci-fi so I could engage with the how to survive problem. As it turns out, with a very low interest in science and botany, I would not survive on Mars and have nothing to add to that conversation. As such, it's not at all engaging.I didn't finish the book, so it might get better, but a few chapters in they talk about things from an Earth perspective and the writing is so bad I had to stop. He literally has one of his characters go ""Hmm"" and rub his chin, and another say ""I didn't want to either. But I'm the administrator of NASA. It's kind of expected."" which are both the kind of things people do in movies, because in books you can take on the perspective of either character and simply make them thoughtful, and the administrator of NASA - they don't have to outwardly express it in such a clunky overt way.So it's too scientific for my liking, which didn't engage me, and the writing can be amateurish and on the nose.

  After reading such good reviews and hearing about the film I gave this book a good shot. I went in with an open mind and didn't mind the factual, scientific style at first as it was intermixed with humour. As the book wore on however, it  also began to wear on me.I like books to be throughly researched and include good detail about the topic. What I don't like is having to read similar sections of scientific text over and over while the story doesn't advance. In this case, the story seems to be going backwards with disaster after disaster where the reader doesn't feel on edge enough to get through the scientific language and find out the fate of the protagonist. It becomes an endless cycle of problem solving and I completely agree wth the 2* review by Mark Kilner that it soon begins to read like a manual. This book is trying to be an adventurous space exploration novel that is ground in fact, but for me it misses the mark somewhere along the way.The other reason I found it difficult was the narrative voice. As I mentioned previously, it's supposed to have a humorous, blunt, satyrical quality to it, but I found that this quickly became stilted and two-dimensional. It didn't completely ring true and rather than becoming immersed in the book, I became aware in parts that I was reading something fictional. And, I hate to admit it, but I couldn't finish it. I let it beat me.Overall this book is not that bad and for some I'm sure that the writing style appeals, but it wasn't for me. The fact that the book is centred around a topic which some readers may not know much about or fully understand (especially if you had science teachers like mine at school) reminds me of another book that I read called Mr. Penumbra's 24-Hour Bookstore. This contained a lot of vocab and facts about coding and programming, which were central to the plot, but in this case rendered it authentic. It was not necessary to follow all of it to enjoy the book, but it was presented in an easy-to-understand way and was mixed with varied situations and a real adventure. If you want a book that focuses on specific themes and a rather unusual plot, read that one instead!

  A great page-turning read. Sometimes bits of the science lost me, but I was desperate to know what happened to Mark Watney (the guy stranded on Mars), and liked the idea that I was learning from the science I did understand.I wouldn't usually choose science fiction that sounds more rockets than alternate reality, but reviews made it sound as though there was more to it and that proved to be the case. The central idea was worked cleverly through people and their responses to situations to the point that I have had less sleep than usual several days this week as it really was too good (in one sense you want a book you can put down at a sensible time of night).

  Maybe it's me, but can genuinely say this is the most boring book I've read in years. Something I wish I knew beforehand is that probably about 75% of the book is made up of the main character's diary entries, during which he describes in layman's terms the minutae of everything character did that day, and I simply didn't care. Very one-dimensional cast of goody two shoes characters, with not an iota of psychological shift in a character stuck alone on a planet for months and months. Harm about to cross his path is pretty much announced neon billboard style.Obviously a lot of people loved this book and of you persist in buying it, I hope you're one of them.

  I'm going to risk general ostracism and contempt here by saying that I really don't get all the love which is directed at The Martian. I've seen so many writers and readers, people who's opinions I generally respect, saying things like, ""It's ""the best SF book they've ever read"" and, ""It should be taught in schools"" that that I picked it up expecting to be absolutely blown aware by a work of mind-shaking brilliance.What I got was a pot-boiler. It's a pretty effective pot-boiler, I'll grant you. It kept me awake and happily distracted from a rather bad toothache while I flipped the pages to see how Weir's stranded astronaut was going to get out of the situation which he's dumped in on page one of the book.But it's not a book I can imagine going back to and reading again, which seems to me to be at least one of the hallmarks of anything aspiring to greatness. It's just too thin. The technical sides of the plot are probably very good. At least I assume they are: my knowledge of Martian science is not strong enough to provide a thorough assessment. But there is (or at least there ought to be) more to science fiction than just a good grasp of technology and science.Things like writing matter. Things like characterisation matter.For me this is where The Martian really misses the mark. For a book which is told so largely in the first person, we get very little sense of the inner life of its protagonist. This is not Robinson Crusoe in space. In fact, if you take out the fact that these are meant to be matters of life and death, the tone is more like a report on ""What I Did During Summer Science Camp.""I've seen it suggested that Weir is using Mark Watney as an unreliable memoir and his narrator is deliberately suppressing his deeper feelings. But the handling of other characters once the story opens out and we start to see how attempts to rescue Watney are proceeding on Earth suggests that creating strong, complex, or even vaguely interesting characters was something that the author was not really concerned with in this book.A few months after reading the book I find that there is not one character who stands out in my memory as being in anyway distinctive. The sole exception is one of the rescue ship scientists who stuck in my mind for the negative reason of seeming a more than usually bad European stereotype. The others just blur into an amorphous mass with crudely defined 'human problems' masquerading as real personalities.This probably all sounds unnecessarily harsh. The Martian is not a bad book for what it is. The million of fans it has acquired show clearly that the book and it's author are doing something right. I guess I was just hoping that it would give me more than it did.

  I had high expectations of this book as the concept of how a man would survive on another planet both physically and mentally interested me and that is why it gets 2 stars. Unfortunately the book fails to focus on the main characters mental or emotional well being at all.  The impact of loneliness,  isolation and mortality on the main character are more or less  ignored and this is where this book falls down!This book endlessly focuses on technical and engineering issues to the point that it becomes tedious!

  I had high hopes but like many others the technical details soon become mind numbing, I was always hoping the storyline would soon be switched to that on earth. The writer spent so much time constantly showing us how clever he was with all the scientific stuff that he never really developing the characters. I didn't really care if he survived or not... In fact at times I was hoping he wouldn't.I expected some darker twist and turns, surely your mental state would deteriorate after that long stranded on Mars? but no, Watney just solves problem after problem and there is no real suspense until the last few pages, (let's face it, you know he gonna survive all the initial problems as there so much book left to read)For a book so heavy in technical detail it's surprisingly dumbed down, with that and constant problem solving when describing the book to my wife I could only compare it to our Daughters tedious Dora the Explorer books.

  After looking at the good reviews I was expecting a lot of this book but within the first few pages I knew it was going to be a struggle to get through because of the writing style or lack of it. The book has a good story and lots, and I mean lots, of scientific/technical explanations. The problem is that the style of writing is very much that of Robinson Crusoe along the lines of ""I got up..., I did this, I did that, I'm going to sleep now..."" etc.It's redeemed somewhat by the twists and turns in story line but if you want a work of literature look elsewhere.

  Two stars instead of one because it's an interesting premise and the author does at least manage to create a varied narrative for something that is, for the most part, a monologue.The writing is woeful. At times there is page upon page of technical information and scientific theorem.  If this was consistent throughout I would wilfully hold up my hands, admit that it's pitched at too high a level for me and walk away without prejudice, but then it's suddenly offset by such adolescent platitude it genuinely feels as though it could have been written by two different people.  Or perhaps one person who thinks only in code and has never had an actual conversation with another human being.About half way through I realised that the techno-poems offered nothing to drive the narrative and I started skim reading them until that given days random malfunction was back in hand.  A deluge of new characters are introduced just in time to stave off the onset of monotony, but their hammy dialogue and awkward exchanges only serve to confirm that this is in fact poor literature on every level.Never one for contrariness, I'm frankly staggered I'm in such a minority.

  The pleasure of The Martian is not so much the question of survival - the fact that much of the book is a first person narrative leaves little room for suspense there - but in the spirit and ambition behind getting the job done. Much of the book’s success lies in the likability of stranded astronaut Mark Watney. He’s straightforward, unpretentious, and has just the sort of resilient spirit one requires to be the main character in an isolated race against time and the Universe (if you need that story to be something other than relentlessly grim).The science - and there is a lot of accurate and detailed science - behind his numerous solutions is sort of hypnotic. There’s way too much detail, and it can go on for pages, but at the same time it’s sort of pleasingly poetic. The wit is unsubtle, a sort of gung-ho optimism that has almost no depth but is so transparent I couldn’t help but buy into it. There’s not much thrill in this thriller, for the result is a foregone conclusion, and the science is such that any attempt to play along at home and work out how he’s going to get out of any given problem is futile unless you’re also an astronaut level engineer.The book is also a structural mess, jumping from different narrative viewpoints (first person, third person, narrative third person) as the author requires, with little understanding of how such devices can interplay. Somehow though, the clumsy execution of the story enhances its authenticity, working in its favour. The Martian sucks you in despite the things that are so clearly wrong with it, and the ending made me want to give a little cheer. If you’re prepared to be a forgiving reader, then there’s a lot to like here.

  Six days ago, the first team of astronauts landed on Mars. A dust storm forces the team to evacuate and return to Earth. In the confusion and drama of the evacuation, Mark Watney is injured and left behind for dead. Discovering he is alone and without any communications, and no hope of retrieval, Watney must come up with a plan to survive until the next team arrives on Mars. But it isn't going to be easy.After watching the movie, I had to read the book, so I acquired it and settled in. And was I in for a treat. Yes, the book is technical (and gives a whole load more information than the movie ever could), given that most of it's format is log entries from a stranded astronaut, but astronaut Mark Watney's take on life and his innate sense of humour and can-do attitude make for a thoroughly enjoyable read.This book is an outstanding offering from Weir, and is very well written. The level of detail (and the research that surely backs it up) is immaculate and he kept me engaged from start to finish. That's actually quite a feat - to be able to be detailed with technical stuff AND keep an audience engaged, and not all writers (or speakers) manage it. Weir pulls it off with aplomb - and a flourish to follow it up.

  I started reading this book with the hope that it would provide some good psychological suspense, as well as of course providing a tempting story line with plenty of twists and turns.The story is a good one, even if the way in which the main character (Mark Watney) becomes stuck on the planet is somewhat hard to believe. However the book lacks any insight into the mind of the man, his thoughts and description of Mars, or any kind of real human feeling. I am aware that Mark Watney's account is supposed to read like a journal, but even then that is hard to accept given his jokey language and almost constant bonhomie, even in the face of some tremendous challenges and stark loneliness.If you love technical details and are prepared to follow it closely I think you will enjoy. Personally I skim read all the tech. If you are after something that scratches a little further beneath the surface then perhaps this book is not for you.

It is well researched and believable.  The outcome of the astronaut's efforts is uncertain until the end. This would be a good holiday or plane journey read.

  I guess I'm a bit of a nerd, but I quite liked the amount of science in this book.  Otherwise I found it didn't live up to the hype.  The main character is so one dimensional and it's so obvious he's going to overcome all the challenges thrown at him, that there isn't much tension - Apollo 13 it ain't.  It just didn't grip me and I found myself skipping ahead.  Strangely, the scenes in NASA back on in Earth seemed to have more depth to them to them than the action on Mars.

  I realise I am a bit late to the party when I see just how many reviews there already are for this exceptional book but this story deserves reviews... and good ones.Mark Watney is stranded on Mars and the next supply ship and possible rescue is due in four years. There is an initial added complication that no one believes he has survived the dust storm that caused the rapid evacuation from the planet of the rest of the crew and so no one is looking for him. Mark is faced with the probability of death by various means; it's just a case of which one will kill him first.What follows is the description of how Mark resolves not to die; his know-how and ingenuity are stretched as he tackles the problems he is faced with. The reader also get to see what is going on back on Earth where the NASA team are faced with their own dilemma and that of the crew returning to Earth without their lost shipmate.I was surprised at how eagerly I absorbed all the descriptions of how Mark could supplement his food supply, produce water and additional energy and attempt to communicate with a very distant Earth. His character is optimistic and despondent, happy, frustrated, accepting and unwilling to give up- a whole gamut of emotions that I would imagine would befall a real, cosmic castaway.The film is just as absorbing but misses out some detail, and one whole section of the story. It didn't spoil my enjoyment and I can see that the cuts had probably been necessary simply from the point of fitting it into a feature-length time-frame.  The story still seemed whole and satisfying despite the ommisions.The Martian is a great story, not just for Sci-fi fans by any means. It's a story about camerarderie, the human spirit and the will to survive and I could read it over again right now!

  Desert island survival in a vacuum on a deserted planet. Meticulously researched, at times it gets caught up as it delights at solving puzzles and creating survival gear out of presumably realistic components. However you don't for a second doubt Watney's resourcefulness, composure or perceptiveness.As a thriller at heart, it makes room for its impressive nuts and bolts at the expense of some thematics, especially on a level of character development, but as the set backs stack up and the plot manoeuvres deftly to the climax, it entertains and more than makes up for its procedural shortcomings.

  Not the amazing story it's been made out to be in posters all over London, didn't like the use of language for the main character, no real dimension to the character either. Story line was a bit samey, something goes wrong, fix it, something goes wrong, fix it. Definitely not Robinson Crusoe on mars. Not an awful book but would probably make a more interesting summer no brainer blockbuster movie then a novel.

  I got through 50% of this book before realising this wasn't a book about a Martian extra-terrestrial, rather a rescue story about a human trapped on Mars. The plot is reasonably good but there are regular passages around fashioning tools from cannibalizing other equipment which are quite geeky and become tedious.

  My first review on Amazon so here goes - the premise of the noval is OK as far as it goes, although by the nature of the plot a lot of the book is very procedural (I did this, then this, then this etc...) and some of the detail is unnecessary in places. The pacing of the story has a few issues, as does the ending which is entirely predicable. My main gripe was with the dialogue which is fairly awful (we are supposed to believe a NASA autonaught talks and behaves like a teenage boy), having said that as something to read on a plane or holiday it does the job.

  I'm not entirely sure what to say about this book. I would not describe it as literature in the formal sense. In fact the writing style is quite juvenile at times, more akin to a boys own story. The 'log' entries become truly wearisome after a while and the continued scientific explanation of the survival story maddening. Watney's language appears to be almost taken from a textbook for space geeks interspersed with periodic 'yay'.I think the story lacks true emotion and desperation. I appreciate that there is a requirement to explain the science but some of the peripheral story is a bit pathetic.Overall I was a bit disappointed.

  I would have given this five stars as I really loved the book and the main character (not having seen the film). took my Kindle with me during the day and snatched time to read on about Mark and his predicament, eager to find out what happened. As usual, I kept checking my Kindle progress to see how much there was left and so at 85%, I was sure there was a big, exciting twist ahead of me - but no, the book just FINISHED!!!!! I was so annoyed! The publishers decided to add the first few chapters of the author's next book to the back of this one, which was why the Kindle progress had been wrong. I HATE this so much. I invested a lot of time in this book and I feel completely and utterly cheated. If I had been able to tell that the book was about to finish, I would have adjusted my reading style accordingly and taken time to enjoy the final few pages - when you read a really good book, it is lovely to slow down and savour the final words, feeling regret that you won't be able to continue reading it and enjoying the time you have left with it. I can't believe how angry I am about it. It happens when publishers put a 'bonus' chapter in a physical book too - you feel that there should have been more of the story because you can feel the extra weight and see the remaining pages. All it has done is to make me NOT want to read that next book because that's the reason why I didn't enjoy the end of this one. I'm so cross.

  My son recommended this too me and I have to admit it's superb.I've never been one for science fiction and if I can't understand how something happened then it might as well been magic beans and fairy dust. This book is all human drama our hero ends up in a situation that he didn't choose and it's that story that is gripping. It helps that our hero has a very unheroic attitude to the situation and the mix is excellent, completely gripping and I thoroughly enjoyed every moment.(The only frustration is that I paid extra for the audio version to run along with the kindle and at 1hr 3mins from the end the audio crashed and stopped so I limped to end of the book and it was a waste of money.)

  I felt like I was never going to finish The Martian, but I did it, finally. There's a lot of science talk in the book, in fact pretty much all of the book is science talk, in the way that not only does it tell you what he needs to do but also how it needs to be done, in great detail. It tells you all the ways it could go wrong, all the ways it could go right, and everything inbetween. For the most part, I found this tolerable and somewhat enjoyable (in the way that I was learning new things), but eventually found it really tedious to get through. Overall though, I give this book 4 stars because although I have just sort of, complained about the book, it was an enjoyable read and I for sure recommend reading it, although it's definitely not to some people's tastes.

  Meticulous nail-biter and superb Sci-Fi thriller aimed not just primarily at adults, but the keenly science-minded. Occasionally overbearing with the unending shower of numbers and quantities, but indicative of just how much planning and research went into the novel; though a manned mission to Mars is decades off, Weir has some incredible foresight - the science appears sound when read on the page. Film rights have been placed in the hands of trusted Ridley Scott, so I can't wait to see the narrative visualised for the masses. Should be the next stellar blockbuster following the likes of Gravity and Interstellar - but read it first!

  This book has fantastic reviews so I was expecting a novel of five star quality. I've just finished the book, and whilst entertaining in places, I can't say I share the thoughts seen the in the majority of reviews.For me there is just far too much techno babble. I have to say that Andy Weir appears to have done a fantastic job researching the ins and outs of space travel. Its all very convincing from a scientific perspective. But the intricate details of how the main character, Mark Watney, rations out oxygen and food is written in a style more fitting for a text book than that of fiction. This is a novel about a man stranded on Mars, completely alone; you'd think it would be full of drama and emotion but there are large parts of the novel that are so technical that they're quite frankly boring.The character of Watney is however extremely likeable. He's very funny and you do find yourself getting attached to him and wanting him to survive. But whereas the scientific aspect of the novel is taken deadly serious the same can't be said about Watney's reaction to his prediciment. He barely seems bothered about the fact he's the sole occupant of a planet and possibly facing dying alone. I'd have thought there'd have been some exploration of the effect of being alone on a planet on the human mind but there's none of that. Watney just seems to crack jokes whenever anything goes wrong which takes away from the drama.Negativity aside I did enjoy aspects of the novel. The book shifts writing styles between diary entries by Watney and third person chapters which mainly focus on characters on Earth. The switching between styles helped keep my attention and the general story was entertaining. I just feel that if about 100 pages of techno talk were cut out the book would have been a much more entertaining read.

  Unfortunately the story follows a common film concept,why have one disaster when you can have an endless series,could he survive all of this,no chance !,his level of skills is mind blowing,would he be saved through international co operation,I don't think so,I guess the film will have to skim over a lot of detail in order to be a reasonable length ! !

  This story is one of the little 77p treasures you find with Kindle.It's about how an astronaut is left behind on Mars by accident and his battle for survival.The man's survival is dictated by the bare resources available, that are finite. So there's plenty of arithmetic from time to time.The effect of a dust storm was very well thought out.

  What more can I say other than Excellent. Even if you've seen the film you should really read this book. So many parts of the book were missed out of, or altered in the film, presumably to keep the running length to something decent. For the most part the book seems to present as a diary kept by Mark Whatney about his time spent on Mars from his being stranded, after his crew-mates were forced to leave thinking he had died, through to his rescue.

  I really enjoyed reading this book. It is a page turner. The technical and practical aspects of surviving on Mars were brilliantly covered and seemed realistic to someone who knows nothing of such things. However, I was really surprised that the other major aspect of the situation, the psychological effects of isolation and loneliness were only mentioned once. It was a big omission for me and somewhat the elephant in the room. I can only assume the author deliberately left this issue out. However, it didn't detract from my enjoyment of the book. The other minor issue was that I didn't like the lead character, he came across to me as arrogant in his interaction with others and everything was a joke, when actually he would probably find the situation extremely serious, it was obviously his way of dealing with it.

  Mark Watney* has a problem. Quite a big problem. He's stranded on the planet Mars (it's a long story) with a year's worth of supplies. No one on Earth knows he's alive and the planned return mission won't land for another five years. What's a guy to do? Well, most of his survival tactics seem to involve setting fire to his habitat...Andy Weir self-published The Martian in 2012 and if there's any proof needed that self-published novels CAN be good, then this - emphatically - is it. The self-published ebook sold like hotcakes before it was picked up by a print publisher the following year and it's now in development as a big-name movie.The story is good, solid, hard science fiction, a cross between any castaway story you care to name and any astronaut-in-peril story you care to name. There's a healthy dash of techno-thriller in the mix with plenty of MacGyveresque science to keep the nerds happy. To be honest, some of the technical descriptions left me standing but it's easy enough to step around these points and get on with the story.The writing is strong, competent and easy to read. However, the delivery swaps between First Person (Watney's Mars Survival Journal) and Third (events back on earth. This jarred to begin with in more ways than one. In particular, Watney's personal account helps to build a strong and sympathetic character portrait, whereas the characters covered in the other sections seem to lack any real oomph, faceless bodies for the most part, whose only role is to move the plot forward. As the story moves forward this becomes less of a problem, but it never quite goes away and the book suffers for it.But what the hell?! The plot is a real corker! While it's nothing new (stranded, struggle to survive, race against time), follows a very klinear and predictable course and the eventual outcome is hardly beyond doubt, Weir somehow manages to weave a classically unputdownable story that easily transcends the narrative problems and literary cliches. I loved it. It's been a long time since I've read deep into the night but, having started reading one evening in bed, I eventually had to force myself to go to bed at 2:30 the following morning and then squeeze in a couple more chapters before truddging - gritty-eyed - to work a few hours later**. Every other chapter seems to be a cliffhanger and the lead character is so engaging (and witty) that you're dragged (willingly) from page to page.In spite of its flaws, this is an enjoyable and hugely impressive debut.* ""Mark Watney"" is no name for an astronaut. ""Buzz"", ""Buck"" or ""Jim"" perhaps, but ""Mark Watney""? It makes the poor guy sound like the third-in-line heir to a failed brewing empire...** Hence the review's title

  I can see how it was so popular, it kept me on the edge of my seat for most of it.Mark Watney is the protagonist in this story about an astronaut who gets stranded on Mars after a freak accident during a storm in which his crew and all the people back on earth presume he is dead. He has to deal with problem after problem, first to just survive and ensure he has enough food etc, then to prepare for his hoped for rescue once people find out he's actually still alive.Now I had seen the film already before reading the book but luckily enough I don't have the best memory so though I knew the general gist of what was going to happen, I'd forgotten the details, so yay to a bad memory! Mark himself is full of quips and one liners, which makes him a tad unrealistic in the environment he's in but does make him interesting to read about. Especially as the amount of figures thrown around can get a bit overdone, so a break from the maths is a good thing.I've heard this is somewhat realistic take on what it might take to survive on Mars, personally I have no idea, but I did find the constant calculations a bit boring sometimes, particularly in the first part. I found the whole thing livened up once people back on earth found out he was still alive and the extra characters definitely helped. From then on it switched from Mark to different people back on earth to his crew, and all these viewpoints gave good perspectives on what was going on and what needed to be done.It was mentioned a few times but I would like to have seen it addressed more though; was the amount of money and resources that was thrown at rescuing one man, who knew the risks before starting, really worth it? Like hardly anyone (other than those directly affected) blinks an eye at people dying all over the world but for something like this, everything is thrown at it. It's very realistic and very human.The pacing is relentless once the story really gets going. I read the last hundred pages or so in one setting and stayed up way too late. The technical details were really interesting though as mentioned I did find myself glossing over parts of it. This was a fun read and the way it was set up was very cinematic so I'm not surprised at all that it was picked up by Hollywood. This was also an intentional but well timed read with the landing of Perseverance on Mars, so that was an added bonus.

  I have never read a book quite like this. The story is told from an interesting perspective - the journal of a single survivor stranded on Mars and seeking to use his creative imagination to exist. I found it a relief when, well into the story, different characters were introduced. I found some of the scientific detail too technical for my taste, and had to take it on trust that it was accurate, but hats off to the author if it was. If you enjoy science fiction with plenty of detail rather than action then this book is probably for you. It took all of my resolve to see it through to the end.

  Written in an easygoing and humorous style, this was easy to read, apart from the tedious and lengthy engineering technical stuff. I skipped over most of it, but that much of it really is unnecessary to the story. Some of the stunts pulled by our hero to survive were frankly ridiculous and unbelievable rubbish. The other thing that bugged me what the complete lack of any sense of wonder or imagination; This is an astronaut abandoned on Mars but there was nothing about Mars. It's an alien planet dude! Give us some imagination, a feel of the place , what's it like? Was there anything there other than sand and dust? The point of SF is to stimulate our imagination and sense of wonder not just to solve engineering problems - that's just a means to an end.

  Mark Watney is stranded on Mars with no way to communicate with NASA (who think he’s dead), and he’s living in a hub designed to last a month with about half a year’s worth of food to sustain him. That doesn’t seem too bad except the next scheduled visit to Mars is years away, so unless Watney can figure out how to create his own food, protect his shelter, and contact earth, he’s going to die on Mars, all alone, in the freezing cold.Written for the most part as a series of diary entries from Mars, the genius in this book lies in its premise and our hero's constant feeling of peril. For everything Watney does right, something else goes wrong and another problem arises, and the novel carries on like that the whole way through, with Watney having to put out fire after fire after fire, both figuratively and literally. It’s the kind of book that doesn’t allow you to put it down because you want to know how he’ll escape.Or IF he’ll escape.

  I guess I made a mistake with this one because I watched the movie before I read the book. I actually think that the movie was a pretty good adaptation of the book and that they did a good job of representing it. Sure, that meant there were  no surprises in store for me when I read the novel, but that didn’t really hamper my enjoyment.I probably don’t need to spend time explaining the plot of this book because it’s been talked about a lot. What I will say is that people are right when they talk about Watney’s sense of humour in it, and I was particularly impressed by the fact that it was originally self-published before being picked up by a mainstream publisher.It turned out to be a super enjoyable read, and the only real problem that I had with it was that some of the more technical parts got a little boring and kind of slowed it all down, so I ended up skimming over them. But at the same time, I also think it was necessary to give the book an authentic feel, and from what I can understand all of the science is well-researched and entirely possible.So for me at least, The Martian is worthy of the hype, but I’m also not surprised that Artemis received mixed reviews. Weir’s writing style really works with this kind of book, but I’m not convinced of how versatile it would be. But if you judge this book for what it is, it’s just a decent sci-fi novel with mainstream appeal. And the fact that it has mainstream appeal means that you’re pretty likely to enjoy it if you pick it up.I’m also pleased to say that even though I’d already seen the movie, the book was still a lot of fun. I particularly enjoyed the references to Watney reading Agatha Christie to keep himself sane and while I initially found them jarring, the switches in perspective to what was happening on earth actually added a lot to the story. I enjoyed it. Go read it some time.

  pooled ink Reviews:4.5 StarsTHE MARTIAN is a standout of science fiction. Brilliant, bold, and badass, it follows one man left behind for dead on Mars who determines to go down swinging as his comrades on Earth watch wide-eyed and shocked. Brilliant minds, gut-wrenching setbacks, and a steady smirk of humor lift the characters off the page into a fresh tale of modern space travel gone wrong.One of this book's biggest successes was its ability to embrace the science and explain it without dumbing it down or coming across as condescending. It didn't overwhelm me with terminology and data but it also kept it real.This book felt so grounded in reality and that feeling of possibility as you witness Mark stretching the achievements of humanity is genius. Nothing felt outlandish or comical in a bad way. The story takes a crazy never-before situation and it works works works from start to solution, from tragedy to resurrection, and it keeps things fresh, edgy, and witty each page of the way.Andy Weir comes out of left field with his brilliant creation and I am glad of it! It's a win for science fiction, for self-published authors, and for human ambition both on and off Earth. It doesn't take big money to create a good book, it only takes a good idea and a bit of talent to see it through.

  Really struggling to get through this. The tech descriptions and obviously huge amounts of research gone into them is really impressive; but on the other hand it feels seriously dumbed down and is very badly written. Annoying characters and really irritating to read - mostly because of the bad jokes and the author feeling the need to explain simple things in brackets every few paragraphs, which makes it feel like a kids book.

  A friend of mine got this novel free with the DVD or a screening of the film and not wanting it, gave it to me. I finished today having read it at lightspeed and literally being unable to put it down.Most will probably know what it's about so briefly, Mark Watney is an astronaut assumed dead following an accident and left behind on Mars by his team.But he survives, the blood from a wound he recieved having become a sticky residue in the Martian atmosphere, temporarily sealing the hole in his spacesuit. He pulls himself together and back to the habitation unit (the Hab) and begins his fight for survival, resolving to keep himself alive for 4 years until the arrival of the next Mars mission.Here the author's scientific background pays dividends as various scenarios are devised by our hero as he works out how to increase his food rations, (potato farming in the hab), re-establish contact with Earth & get to where he can be picked up again.Watney is a hero it's easy to identify with, although more clever than most of us we can identify with his sense of humour (watching old 70's sitcoms e.g. the US ""Three's Company"" and deciding a cast change ruined it) and his compassion (whatvere goes wrong her always insist his crew could have done nothing other than leave him behind and were right to do so.There are a number of near fatal setbacks which are edge of the seat stuff and will have you wondering how on Mars he will get out of that! But and this is why there should be prizes and acclaim galore for Mr Weir, it really is a hopeful rather than grim story.Most of the story is from his point of view in 1st person log entries but we also have 3rd person sections at NASA credibly covering their reaction to discovering he may still be alive and their attempts to get food to him and get him home.Credibly the whole world once the story goes global are routing for him to come home, does he get there? You'll have to read it yourself.I'll be keeping an eye out for Andy Weir novels, word is he may be doing more SF.And I'll urging everyone to read this!

  I'm sure the movie is great, but the book reads like a damn science text book... right the way through. I was disappointed because I like science fiction and I even understand the science involved to certain degree, but this was way too caught up in the detail and not enough in the emotional side of things. The humour was actually quite good at times, and the fundamental storyline itself is great - but it just bored the pants off me!

  After the introduction and setting out the story, I felt the beginning of the book was a little slow. However, following this, it picked up and I very much enjoyed it. I felt the book sometimes was bogged down by scientific descriptions which, to someone who doesn’t have a science background, I often found hard to fully process. However, I understand why this was done as the book is written from the perspective of an intelligent astronaut - it makes sense he would write a log in a technical manner. While I didn’t warm to Mark (the protagonist) initially, as the books goes on, you really root for him; living every small victory or setback with him. I liked the switching perspectives from Mark to the rest of NASA and made it easier to understand some of the scenarios Mark experienced. Overall, the sometimes complicated presentation didn’t detract from what was a compelling tale of one man on an alien planet fighting a most human of battles: one for survival.

  The novel tells the story of astronaut Mark Watney, a botanist and engineer on a 31 day, 6 man mission to Mars. The mission is abruptly aborted due to freak weather and, during the evacuation, Watney is injured. The rest of the crew, believing him dead, leave Mars without him. The novel tells the story of how he attempts to survive alone with limited rations in an inhospitable environment.I was a little concerned that the science in this novel would make it a difficult read for me. I knew from looking at reviews and from speaking to friends who had already read it that it was quite science heavy. However, I needn’t have been worried. Whilst there were of course elements which were quite technical, these were all either well explained for the layman or done in such a way that a full understanding was not necessary to follow the plot.I found this a gripping read and would highly recommend it to anyone with even a passing interest in space.

  A great read. In the same vein as 'Castaway' and 'Gravity' if you want some idea of the story.I love the self depreciation and wise cracks from the protagonist, Mark Watney, which makes you root along for him in his survival on Mars, after being mistakenly left for dead after a brutal dust storm after only a few days in on a Mars mission.The book unfolds as part of a mission log, with Watney continuing to log in, reporting his time on Mars. And being an astronaut, botanist and engineer, it does get technical at times, which is part of the charm! The book also switches viewpoints later on to the rest of the crew of mission on their way back to Earth as well as to Houston mission control and their efforts to save Watney.It kind of read like a script in parts, so at least the book probably lent well to the movie adaptation. But still a very enjoyable read and recommended.

  Okay. Wow. That wasn’t at all what I was expecting. My mind has been blown. I have no idea where to start this review. I have so much to say. Why did I do this to myself? I did not think I would have this many emotions. I really don’t know how to react.Breathe.Please be warned, the following review is likely to be somewhat disjointed due to the fangirl within.I’ll start with something simple. I wasn’t expecting to read this book so soon. For quite some time I have had it on my to-read list, yet as it was so far down the list, it was going to remain there awhile. Whenever there is a lot of hype surrounding a book, I generally leave it sitting on my bookshelf for a while. I let the drama cool off a bit. However, as my friend wishes to go and see the movie I had to bump it up my list. I apologise to all the heartbroken books in my room, but I refuse to see the movie first. It is never fun that way. Admittedly it isn’t fun for those around me when I have read a book before going to see the movie (I’m one of those really critical people, one of those people who point out every difference), but that is their problem.Entering a book whilst there is still hype is scary. Yes, the hype has cooled somewhat compared to what it was like a few months ago – but it is still scary! It is not at, what I deem, ‘the safe reading level’. Alas and alack, that cannot be helped. Fortunately for me, I enjoyed the book so much I do not care about the hype. For once, I actually understand the hype. Never before have I given such a hyped book a five star rating. It is unheard of in my book reading history. Usually the hype ensures I will never enjoyed it as much as other people expect me to. With this one, though, the wall was thoroughly destroyed. It was a five star book, and I am going to be one of those annoying ‘you need to read it, why haven’t you read it, hurry up and finish it’ people.Don’t get me wrong, it wasn’t quite a full five stars. Ninety-nine percent of the time, I round down. It is only in extreme situations where I round books up. Never before have I rounded up to a full five stars. Usually these guys are lumbered with a four star rating and a side note of how it almost made it to five stars. So, yet again, we have a first. This is the first hyped up book I have given a five stars, and this is the first book I have rounded up to a five. If that doesn’t tell you something about the book, if that doesn’t convince you it is worth a read, then I’m not sure if you’re understanding what I am saying.Honestly, it was so wonderful. I was gushing from the get-go. I was around one hundred pages in when my friend knocked on the door so we could work on our essays, and I almost told her to go away. I did not want to put the book down, even if it meant I failed an assignment. Instead of sending her away, I invited her in and got to work on my fangirling. From that moment on, I have been unable to stop the gushing. It is an endless cycle of me repeating the mantra ‘it is so good’.Enough of that, though. I should probably tell you why it was so good.Let me start with the simplest thing, the first thing you will all notice: Mark Watney. His character is so wonderful. You would expect someone deserted on a planet to slowly go insane, to lose hid good humour, yet such is not the case with Mark. He is such an entertaining character. His voice is so wonderful. Such a thing makes the book easily accessible to all, as you’re not working through a book that reads like a scientific paper. Even those of us who have a scientific background find such papers dull, and you don’t want that in a book. Some might find this weird – after all, Mark is sharing his story so that the next people to land on Mars will be able to find out what happened to him – yet it all makes perfect sense. Mark explains it himself: this is for everyone to read. This is to let the world know what happened. He is a nice enough guy to turn his darkest time into amusement for the masses. How can you dislike such a guy? If that isn’t enough, he’s a bit of a nerd too – so you’ll get the geeky references a lot of us book nerds love.I could rant and rave about Mark’s character for a very long time, but I’ll keep it to that. My words cannot do his character justice. He is truly amazing. Without a doubt, you’ll love him. He really is the kind of guy you want as a best friend.If the notion of a super interesting and highly entertaining main character has you hanging around for more, fear not – the story is wonderful too. I’m sure you’re all thinking it (I thought it myself before I started reading), this story has been done before. There are numerous examples of stories where the main character is stranded and needs to stay alive until help can come – even within this genre, with people being stuck on a deserted planet. What makes this one so special? Well, we’ll go back to Mark for just a minute more (never believe me when I say I’m done with a topic, if I’m fangirling I will always go back to it). Mark gives us a new voice to such a story. Rather than panic, we have humour. Rather than fear, we have determination. Moreover, it’s not merely Mark’s voice that makes it so wonderful. There is so much happening within such a short book: what can goes wrong will go wrong. Every time it seems as though he may last out, a new issue arises. More importantly, we’re not dragged down by countless pages of description regarding a single point that will be blown away when the trouble hits. Whenever the trouble hits, we’re straight to the point. We do not beat about the bush. We’re told what it is. We’re told what is happening. We do not need to fear that things are going to be dragged out.Don’t worry, just because things are told as they are, it doesn’t not mean you’re going to be confused by the science stuff. It is all explained in simple terms. You do not need a scientific mind to understand what is going on. I admit I may be somewhat bias as I’ve always had a love for science (those people who asked me why I took the physics class last year due to astronomy being involved can kick themselves out of a window because my knowledge of Mars is now beyond the average and I was like ‘ha, look at what I know’ throughout this book), yet it should not go over the top of your head. Even if you don’t quite understand the science stuff, it is still easy to understand what is going on. Remember, Mark is making sure everyone can understand what is going on. He wants the masses to read this. Why fill it with information that will leave people unsure of what they’re reading? No, Mark isn’t that cruel – when stuff gets potentially confuses he gives you a bit of a breakdown.That being said, the reason I didn’t give it a mental full five stars was in part due to the science stuff. Don’t get me wrong, it’s all well researched but there are some aspects where it is not one hundred percent. It doesn’t matter to the story. A lot of people won’t notice, but there are some less than perfect moments with the science. Still, it’s all so well done that you won’t realise there are less than perfect details. You won’t realise that some changes have been made to move the story forward in the direction it needed to. This, of course, is merely the pedantic side of me coming out. It’s a work of fiction – it does not need to be perfect (hence why I did not let this drag down the rating, as it truly is such a small thing).I have now noticed how long this review is getting. I believe this may be the longest review I have written (and I have written a fair few thousand plus words fangirl reviews before). So, to prevent you all from hating me too much, I’ll try to bring this to an end.The Martian is truly wonderful. It was so much more than I expected it to be. I completely understand – and agree – with the hype. If you haven’t picked it up, I really suggest you do. It is not a decision you’ll regret. It is the must read of the year, without a doubt – if only so you do not ruin the fun by watching the movie first.Speaking of the movie, I say this all of the time, but there is no way the movie can hold up to the book. The book is such an emotional whirlwind, that you go from giggling to damaged heartstrings within a paragraph. We all know Hollywood isn’t the best when it comes to those kinds of extremes. I fear Mark will end up losing all of his humour. Part of me has no wish to watch the movie now, knowing what I do, yet I promised to watch it with a friend so I shall. I would offer to edit this review to tell you how well it holds up – but based on my book fangirling I believe it is safe to say in advance that it will not hold up. That isn’t to say it will be bad… it just won’t be the book.So yeah, wow.

  I haven’t seen the film, yet could not imagine anyone else but Matt Damon playing Watney’s part when he declares ‘Yay, I’m pretty much f..cked’ and ‘Now I’m off to play with drugs and radiation.’ How fitting that seventies TV is his only diversion against the harsh reality? But it is the irony that defines this book as well as an entertaining physics and chemistry lesson.This is all because astronaut Watney finds himself stranded on Mars after his team leave, mistaking him for dead. The novel asks ‘what if?’ knowing what we now know about Mars. And so Watney is up against extreme cold, low gravity, dust storms and the sterile environment. How he was going to get out of this one without starving, suffocating, dying of thirst or blowing himself up? The answer to some of these problems involves potatoes, duct tape and communicating Morse code via rocks.I enjoyed Watney being ahead of me in finding solutions, and some of his dilemmas are truly nail-biting. A wrong turn on the edge of a dust-storm and he is dead and what could be worse than hearing air escaping from his spacesuit? In any situation, Watney could die in an instant.My only issue is that despite Watney’s NASA training, being alone for 18 months on a desolate planet would be a tremendous strain on the human psyche. Where was being spooked, having a nervous breakdown or craving intimacy? He didn’t seem to miss ‘green’ or the seasons or a girlfriend. There were virtually no descriptions of the characters or of Mars’ landscape. What about the light, the sky? At times, I didn’t really feel I was there.An entertaining and informative read but I felt the science stuff outweighed the other aspects of the Mars experience from a lone astronaut’s point of view. Still, I loved Watney’s tongue-in-cheek.

  I recently started reading this book and it is very readable in a nerdish sort of way. I'm currently bogged down in his desire to create a potato field in his habitat to feed himself once his dried food runs out. The reason I'm bogged down is nothing to do with the science of creating soil and water, which is fascinating, it's because a little voice in my head keeps screaming 'But you don't need to create a field to grow potatoes! Use the bulk storage boxes your dried food packages are stored in (or better still, the rock sample sacks) to create potato barrels! Add 4"" of your sewage - Mars soil mix with ""2"" of Earth soil above then add a potato piece and bury under a mixture of Mars and Earth soil. Water lightly. When the first green leaves appear, add more Mars-Earth soil mix and continue ""Earthing up"" every time the leaves show through. That way you can grow an entire barrel of potatoes in a tiny area using very little soil or water and you keep the edible tubers away from the raw sewage. As for the peas and beans, grow those in shallow containers of your sewage-soil mix (or plant them in your potato barrels once you've harvested the potatoes). Once you've harvested them, chop the vines up and add to the soil mix to compost down - potatoes will love this soil. Peas and beans ""fix"" nitrogen so you enrich your soil to keep it going longer, and you gain another edible crop. You can create as many ""barrels"" as you've got containers for and you will grow vastly more potatoes that you think possible.""Having read the above, I realize that I am probably as much of a nerd as the protagonist is! The good thing about the protagonist's focus on creating soil and water, is that intensity really draws you into his reality so my rating may well improve.I initially gave this book 3 stars but have increased that rating simply because things have really picked up. I don't want to spoil the story for anyone so will simply say it is well worth getting past the potato growing - which actually has some very funny scenes.When this story takes off, it really takes off. I stayed up until 2am on two consecutive nights and did very little during the daytime because I really had to know how it ended and I never, ever cheat by turning to the end of the book early. Well done Andy Weir on producing a fantastic read.

  Absolutely loved this, although I do wonder if it’s that accessible or interesting to somebody who isn’t into science. It’s certainly not your typical sci-fi (good - because I’m not keen on that genre) and it kept me hooked. I used the audiobook which I found fantastic. I didn’t think I was going to like it but bought it off the back of the good reviews and was not disappointed. If you like a lot of technical detail in your stories (lots of maths, stats, logistics etc) then give it a go. If you don’t then I think you *may* find it a bit boring.

  Omg I hated this book. The single most boring smarmy book I have ever (almost) read. It's like a 14 year old science genius wants to impress his peers with a very detailed plan of how to survive on Mars. Calculations and scientific trials explained in minute detail whilst we learn nothing about the main character. He has no emotions and could even be a robot called Ford Prefect!Subjected myself to 20% of this torture then abandoned.

  Whilst it does have lots of cool science in it which is interesting, I do not find the protagonist either likable or a plausible astronaut. He sounds like a whiny teenager with no appreciation for beauty or irony or anything beyond the direct mechanics of his survival.Also, even though the science is impressive there are a few holes - for example on page 14 he talks about spreading his own manure on his crop and says something like 'this can spread disease, but the only pathogens in this soil are the ones I already have so it's ok.'With this belief he would get very sick, as one huge problem with food hygiene is bacteria from the large intestine getting into the wrong part of the digestive system through consumption of contaminated food.I've not read all the way to the end, so maybe it's mentioned later, but he does some pretty detailed CO2 and oxygen calculations and he hasn't factored in the CO2 and oxygen produced and consumed by his huge crop. CO2 levels can be a limiting factor for plant growth. Also he may poison himself with all the oxygen they produce.The hero doesn't speak like a highly trained scientist. He doesn't use the NASA jargon that would have been used around him for years, but instead uses crude, vulgar and very un-scientific terms for things. Instead of 'solid waste' its 'crap' or 's***' and the martian soil is 'crud' ectNot really worth reading unless you're really into the mechanics of space flight

  What a find! Occasionally Richard and Judy surprise me with an unusual choice that turns out to be a piece of undiscovered gold.Who would have though that a story billed as 'Castaway meets Apollo 13' would have nearly made me late for work?! But science won me over, science and space thrills.It's simple enough to convey: a team working on Mars is surprised by a dust storm. One of the team is lost with a hole in his suit, the others told to evacuate. Leaving him behind, he wakes up later to discover his situation. His team think him dead, NASA think he's dead. He's on his own.Absolutely HOOKED. And I'm not ashamed to say that I have a huge crush on botanist/engineer Mark Watney. Huge. He narrates the story as journal entries from Mars, as problem after problem must be overcome - his suit, water, heat, food just for starters. Each time his sense of humour only heightens the tension as you see just how terrifying it must be there for him to make light of it later.It's a book with a LOT of science in it. I won't pretend to understand more than 1 in 10 of Mark's explanations and solutions, but it doesn't matter. The overall terror, the human story, the excitement mean you can follow Mark's progress without having to catch all the terminology.It does feel well-researched though. You do feel you can picture Mars: the cold, the barren landscape, the loneliness.Mark's story changes from Castaway's one-man-trial partway through to more Apollo 13 as the NASA side of the tale begins to filter in and awareness of his 'alive' status arises. Earth's reaction is well detailed. NASA's plans and frantic meetings feel real, the desperation to save this lone man and the millions poured into it touching.And yet Mark keeps his irreverent sense of humour as he reaches ever closer to a lonely death.... Just how will it end?I was on the edge of the bed desperately turning pages to get there. I loved the writing, the back-and-forth Mars-to-Earth narration. I loved Mark's cobbled-together and insane plans. I loved the tension and space talk (even if I didn't follow it all). You do not have to be a techie to enjoy this.I've already got a few library customers to order this. They better stay away from Mark though :)Looking out for the author's next book. Excellent way to get noticed, Mr Weir.

  Upon glowing reviews from 3 of my blogging friends I picked this up recently. I had anticipated keeping it for my book club choice but then I discovered the movie is released at the end of September and wanted to read before then so in I went.Once you get your head around all the 3 letter acronyms in the first few chapters it's a steady read although initially I did find myself constantly checking back to the beginning to remind myself what they were.I will admit I got a bit lost and a bit bored with all the science-y techy stuff; for example when he was trying to make water. I had no idea what was going on or how he was doing what he was doing, I just had to appreciate the sense of urgency, the importance and the danger from the procedures.I really enjoyed the humour of Mark Watney's character and hope that this will translate to the big screen.  ""I just had to get something to stand on. I used a geological sample container (also known as ""a box"").""  ""Then I got a medium flexible sample container (""Ziploc bag"")""If you breakdown, get lost or get stranded on Mars for eighteen months, he's the guy you want to be with. The majority of this book is the urgency to save Mark but I never actually felt it was fast-paced in terms of its writing, in some areas it was quite slow. Although I read the last couple of chapters in about 10 minutes!!If you love movies like Apollo 13, Mission to Mars and Red Planet you'll enjoy this book, even if (dare I say it) you're not a reader or a sci-fi lover as you'll be routing for Watney's survival from page one.The movie adaptation is out in the UK at the end of September; you can watch the trailer here:[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNZRR4qzL1Q]But read the book first!!!!

  I loved every word of this book.  Parts of it are almost unbearably tense, parts of it are deeply inspiring.  Other parts are just genuinely funny.  It manages to pack a lot of emotional distance in a relatively small package - appropriate, perhaps, for a book in which the fragile supply lines of orbital economics are a major feature.  I really don't want to say too much about it for fear of spoiling some genuinely gripping story-telling, but I can say I enthusiastically recommend it without a single reservation.More than that though, there were a few occasions that brought a tear to my eye - not because of what was happening per se, but because it brings home just how genuinely heroic the pursuit of space travel actually is, and how little we as a planet appreciate it.  A record of success that is, objectively, astounding[1] has robbed NASA and all the other global space agencies of the awe they really deserve.  In addition to telling a gripping 'lost in space' yarn, The Martian also communicates well the epic scale of the challenges routinely overcome as we stretch beyond the Earth.  Mark Watney may be fictional, but that doesn't detract from the heroism that goes along with strapping human beings onto a massive bomb and sending them hurtling into a dark, hungry vacuum just to increase human understanding.  In many respects, and somewhat counter-intuitively, it's as much a love letter to space exploration as it is a tale of survival in the harshest of environments.[1] There are failures, sure, but they're failures by and large doing amazing things.

  The MartianTechnical books, be they fact or fiction are either interesting or dull as anything.Andy Weir’s clever trick is to inject survival humour into Mark’s Narrative Log.He makes sure all other dialogue is short & sweet, this ensures a smooth, uninterrupted flow of story.While Mark seems to outdo Bear Grylls in survival things also don’t go to plan at times.Human resilience & loyalty win over. I haven’t seen the film & quite frankly don’t wish to.I’m now very much looking forward to reading Artemis.

  Had this book been written in the 1970s, it's likely to have been penned by a lady writer and been full of maundering sentimentality, with the central character an emotional cripple, hardly the sort you'd send into space, except for dramatic effect.  It's what happened in those days.  Luckily this didn't happen here and the muse struck Andy Weir instead, very recently, and the writing manages to avoid the pitfalls of earlier sci-fi eras.  At the start its very technical and full of the kind of numbers hard sci-fi fans love.  Then it cools off and settles down for the soft sci-fi audience, a journey through logical ingenuiity and intelligent survival.  The narrative, derived from dictated log tapes, is full of wide-boy wit, and spares no expense at picking hilarious holes in media from the 1970s  (see what I did there? the 1970s connection?)

  A rare example of when the film is better than the book. Far too much detailed science, which the film managed to abridge. For me, it's a fantastic explanation of why people will never live and prosper on Mars - it's because they would have to live in bubble shelters all the time. (The low mass of Mars, and its lack of magnetic field, mean that any atmosphere would just bleed away like the original one did.) So no more interesting to live on than the Moon, or any other lump of rock in the Solar System.

  A freak accident during a horrendous storm leads to Mark Watney, botanist and astronaut, being left behind on the surface of Mars, presumed dead. However, when a fortnight later satellite images from the site show evidence of his survival NASA's finest scramble to bring Mark home, but can they counteract all the difficulties of the hostile environment of Mars and the danger of space travel to bring all six of the crew back alive?As a reader, you cannot help but feel bombarded with the science and technology in this sci-fi thriller from the beginning. The problems encountered by Mark and his problem-solving soon became compulsive reading as I became less irritated by the technical information and more in awe of his resourcefulness. I don't think the narrative or the character would have worked as well without a good sense of humour and the basic tenacity he had alongside the will to survive.The mainstay of the story is scientific problem solving, but somehow Weir manages to weave in emotions such as fear and helplessness in an environment where you would expect people to be mechanical and emotionless. Ultimately this story isn't about Mars, but about humanity and the value of life.Mark's crew, although not actually with him for most of the book, are a close-knit bunch of characters who were easy to read. Houston had a number of unsung heroes, who put everything into this project to save one life.With a bit of humour and a whole lot of nail-biting, I can honestly say this could be the best sci-fi thriller I will read this year. Sci-fi isn't a genre I gravitate to when it comes to books but I am a huge Sci-fi movie fan and I have yet to watch The Martian.I felt bereft when the book ended as I had become so attached to Mark Watney and his quest for survival on Mars but there appears to be talk of a series and so we might hear more from him and the rest of the crew of Ares3.

  This has got to be the best book I've read in years. Weir has managed to pull off a rare feat - making a multitude of scientific disciplines and mathematics sexy and accessible while not watering-down or glossing over concepts. Having struggled with Greg Egan and to some extent Stephen Baxter, Weir has found the perfect balance - informative and relevant. There are no rambling pages of tech-speak, helped by the fact that the main source of information comes from the hero, Mark Watney's log. This format keeps the story moving along and cuts out all the guff that plagues other books in a similar genre. The log entries are interspersed with asides from events at NASA and the Hermes spacecraft in a more traditional format. This works extremely well as it seems to emphasise Watney's plight from the viewpoint of ""experts"", colleagues and family, while at the same time it allows the reader to take a breath. Although the peripheral characters are well-drawn, they are not over-exposed, so that we are not distracted from the main focus of the story. Indeed, we don't even suffer too much introspection from Watney himself (yes I'm looking at you Solaris!), but we do get plenty of humour and doggedness. This helps to keep up the adrenaline and make it un-put-down-able. You just know that there's a catastrophe just waiting to happen over the next few pages...

  A bit too clever for me.  Loved the story line, but far too much in-depth science for me.  I sort of understood it, but couldn't be bothered to try after a while. Would suit someone who fully understands the sciences.

  I received a copy of The Martian from the publisher in return for an honest review.“I’m stranded on Mars. I have no way to communicate with Earth. I’m in a Habitat designed to last 31 days. If the Oxygenator breaks down, I’ll suffocate. If the Water Reclaimer breaks down, I’ll die of thirst. If the Hab breaches, I’ll just kind of explode. If none of those things happen, I’ll eventually run out of food and starve to death. So yeah. I’m screwed.”Mark Watney is the best male character I have come across during all my years of reading. I love his smarts, sarcasm, wit and pure determination. Watneys dialogue is what made the book for me, he was just so much fun to be in the company of, despite his situation. I believe this has to the be the first time I have said this, not only in a review but ever... I developed a huge book crush on Watney, my first one ever! Seriously, who needs romance for book boyfriends, I'll take Watney over them all any day.The plot was very well done and the tension and pace held my attention from start to finish. There was a lot of science in the story, some I understood, some I didn't but it honestly didn't matter either way. The writing style is impressive, Watney is in a very serious situation, high stakes, big risks and trying to survive the impossible but it's unique, interesting, hilariously funny, riveting and full of tension. Yet despite all the seriousness of his situation, all the science talk and the danger, it's fun, it's lots of fun and that is all down to the author's writing style. The author has taken a life or death situation, all the highs and lows, injected lots of sarcasm and humour and he's turned it into something unlike anything I have read before.The Martian is at it's heart a science fiction book but it's more than that. It's got adventure, humour, tension, thrills and chills. It's both character driven and plot driven. Really it has it all. Should you choose to give this one a go, don't be put off by the science. It seems complicated and hard to follow at first but trust me when I say, it doesn't matter. The story will grab you and before you know it you'll have learned and understand a lot of the science. The bits you don't? Well, by that point you are so hooked it doesn't matter!The Martian has easily shot right up to the top of my favourite reads of 2014, it's well deserving of all the hype that surrounds it and I highly recommend picking this one up.

  Now The Martian is a read that everyone on Goodreads seems to be talking about and seems almost universally loved, so I had a bit of a shock three or four chapters when I found I wasn’t really liking it that much. The reason – the science  - there is a lot of physics in this read and at first it seemed to go way over my head. But, I persevered and I am so glad I did, because pretty soon I was hooked and I ended up loving this read. It is a story of human endeavour against the odds, about never giving up even when the odds are totally stacked against you. I think though that the real reason I ended up loving this book was the main character, Mark Watney. What can I say about him? Well, he is funny, cheeky, irreverent, positive thinking, a doer. He is courageous and resourceful and it is his constant problem solving that really made me warm to him. Before I knew it I was rooting for him and desperately wanting him to survive. He is stuck in probably the harshest environment not yet known to man, where the slightest little accident could kill him, yet time and time again he puts his “problem solving” cap on and works out a solution. He is a very real character, one that I totally fell for and in the end it almost felt as if I was reading about a real person. Similarly, the physics, despite being way over my head at times, felt real and feasible.It is a cracking read and now I cannot wait to see the film and from what I have seen of it from the trailer there are a few subtle differences so it should be well worth seeing.

  Martian MacGyverThis is one of the most entertaining reads I’ve had in a while. For those of you looking for a Star Wars style adventure with futuristic technologies then this isn’t the book for you. For those interested in a space story told within the restraints of real, actual physics then it most definitely is.Mark Watney is a resourceful astronaut who finds himself accidentally stranded on Mars, abandoned by a crew who believed him dead. Because of orbital mechanics they can’t return for him, and because of planning restraints NASA can’t organise a rescue mission for a long, long time.Unfortunately for Watney the one thing he doesn’t have is time. He has to survive on his engineering and botanical skills alone, and by utilising the various items his mission left behind on the surface. It doesn’t help that he’s the only living organism on a dead planet devoid of food and oxygen and heat; the most isolated human in the universe.He tells his story in diary form and I warmed to his character very quickly due to his attitude and sense of humour. I even laughed out loud on occasion at his turn of phrase.

  OK, so I can appreciate that this book is impeccably researched. I mean, I assume it is. It could all be nonsense and I wouldn't know any better. And it's a promising, dramatic premise, and the detail of how you go about a) surviving and b) escaping from Mars single-handed is interesting, to a degree. But only to a degree. The problem is that there's nothing else here.The protagonist, botanist Mark Watney, outlines each problem to us in his irritating blog-style log entries, and then takes us through the solution he's worked out in mind-numbingly tedious detail. I mean, if I really wanted to know, step-by-step, how one goes about managing and replenishing an oxygen supply, or rewiring a communications device I'd have read a textbook, not a novel.I wouldn't have minded if Watney were a more interesting character, but he's boring at best, and irritating at worst. Not only is there no psychological depth but he has no character arc whatsoever. His ordeal seems to have no effect on him, and he's the same guy on page 369 as he was on page 1. Mars itself is similarly ignored as a subject: we get no sense of what it feels like to be there, and the book is completely lacking in atmosphere (like Mars, I guess).There's plenty of dramatic incident, plot twists, a frantic finale, and I'm sure the film version will be very impressive. In fact, it'll probably improve on the book as they'll probably ditch a lot of the science and concentrate on the characters. Which is what Weir should have done.

  For those unfamiliar, the book is about an astronaut (Mark Watney) stranded on Mars without communication or backup from Earth/NASA. Mark must grow his own potatoes and put his practical skills to use in a struggle for his own survival, but the odds are against him because the next Mars probe won’t arrive for a long time and he may run out of food, oxygen, or water before then. Any of a hundred different things could go wrong, from the habitation to the rovers.The Martian used retrospective first-person tense to good effect, relating Mark’s experience in a series of diaries listed as ‘sols’. The tense captured Mark’s hilarious take on his situation, and made for engaging reading.My main criticism is the overuse of scientific terms and mathematical calculations, which was a bit overwhelming at times because not all of the calculations made sense to me, even if it was supposedly authentic.Still, there were enough engaging chapters, and it was a good book overall.

  I think that The Martian is a particularly difficult book to review without giving away spoilers.  That said, I think I’ve come to it quite late, so perhaps everyone has already read it and / or seen the film, so maybe it’s not one to worry about.Following an accident that causes his team to abandon their mission on Mars ahead of schedule, Mark Watney has been stranded.  Alone.  His position is dire – he has no way to leave Mars, his food supplies are limited, and he has to rely on technology that could breakdown at any moment for water, heat and oxygen.  And Mars is a fair distance away, so a rescue mission would be difficult, even if anyone knew that he was still alive…I wasn’t sure what to expect from The Martian.  I haven’t seen the film yet (I like to read the book first!) but I was aware of the premise.  I really enjoyed it – more than I expected to.  I don’t think I’ve read a novel that manages to maintain such tension throughout in the way that this does.  And there’s plenty that could go wrong, and not just the things that you expect.There is a fair amount of science to gets to grips with – everything Watney does to aid his survival he explains to you.  But, it’s relatively jargon free and easy to understand.  And it is fairly essential to the storyline.  Whether it’s true or not is another matter entirely – I’ve no idea.  I don’t really care.  It sounded feasible, and that’s enough for me.I think that The Martian says a lot about the human will to survive against the odds.  No matter what the situation, I think that humans are hardwired to do whatever they can to keep going.  There are plenty of examples of this, both in real life and in works of fiction, and even though this particular situation isn’t one that we’re likely to find ourselves in, I think that the principles are the same.I think that this is a great novel, and it’s easy to see why it’s been made into a film – I imagine it translates extremely well to the big screen.  Highly recommended.Review originally posted on josbookblog.co.uk

  On 1st of December 2014 I bought a copy of  The Martian (digital, February 2014) [Kindle ASIN: B00FAXJHCY] by Andy Weir andNON, JE NE REGRETTE RIEN!The Martian aroused a lot of interest. Stellar reviews popped up and finally it won the GOODREADS CHOICE AWARDS 2014 in the category science fiction. In the meantime there are nearly 61000 ratings with an average of 4.36 stars and nearly 11000 reviews over at GOODREADS.Today I add my two cents.The DeliveryThe 334 pages are divided into five main parts which are subdivided into 34 consecutively numbered chapters followed by an epilogue.Does this book deserve all the praises? I can answer the question with one word: YES!In a case you expect criticism I must disappoint you. Instead I will try to explain why The Martian is one of the best books I read in 2014.Mars also known as the ""Red Planet"" is the second smallest planet in the Solar System and it is the fourth planet from the Sun.After the Moon the ""Red Planet"" is the next goal in the history of manned spaceflight.That means so far (January 2015) no human being left his traces on Mars. The travel to Mars is still science fiction.But thanks to several unmanned exploration missions we know a lot about the planet. Add to this the known knowledge of botany, the experience of manned spaceflight to the Moon and orbital mechanics. Based on that it should be possible to write a realistic book about a manned Mars mission.That is what author Andy Weir delivered with The Martian. But he delivered so much more.He gave the mission a ""face"" in form of  astronaut Mark Watney. This strong, intelligent, humorous, flexible, smart, reflective, persistent and articulately individual is such a believable, lovable and adorable character. It is nearly impossible to deny to follow Mark Watney through thick and thin.The cherry on the cake is to combine the realistic mission with the extraordinary character in a cast away situation.To be the only human being on Mars with limited resources, no communication with Earth and no hope to be rescued - Only a person with the personality of Mark Watney is able to avoid the state of shock and to face fate in a most positive way.So please visualise the situation mentally - He is alone, nobody to communicate with except himself, in matter of life and death.In order not to go mad you need to talk to yourself and put every thought and every idea and every plan to a diary. That is the reason why the first chapters deal with a lot of explanations. I admit that I did not understand every detail but the descriptions  - for example how to produce soil on Mars - made the scenery so true-to-life.I know that there are readers who did not really like this passages. But from my point of view the story would not work without. The inventiveness of Mark Watney is impressive. That also shows why it takes a long time and endless tests to find the right persons for such a mission.Of course Apollo 13 and Cast Away and MacGyver popped up in my mind because you  each mission/person is in one way or the other included in the story. Bur these are three different stories and The Martian is just one.It is amazing to read how Mark Watney extents and change his plans after he found a way to get oxygen, food and water on a more or less regularly base.I admit I dropped the book and applauded when Mark found a way to communicate with Earth.That means there are more Persons involved than in Robinson Crusoe.With the start of communication the story continues at three different places: Mars, Earth and the spaceship on the way back to Earth.Of course one can say that a few characters on Earth look a bit stereotype. But that did not disturb my reading pleasure.The whole story is full of dramatic events and the final ... No, no ... you have to read the book on your in order to know what happens with Mark Watney  ....This is the best  science fiction novel I read in 2014. No other book delivered a better symbiosis of entertainment and science on such a high level.The InevitableYou want science fiction with a lot of science presented in an entertaining way?You look for a This strong, intelligent, humorous, flexible, smart, reflective, persistent, articulately and believable character?You want to know how it is possible to survive on Mars for a certain time?Then I recommend to read The Martian (digital, February 2014) [Kindle ASIN: B00FAXJHCY] by Andy Weir

  With close on two thousand reviews by now, this book hardly needs another one.  But I was so thrilled to read old-style sci-fi, with that sense of wonder and going to the stars (or at least the 4th planet), that I had to praise it.The Martian is not a rewrite of Stranger from a Strange Land, or a biography of ray Bradbury.  It puts the science back into science fiction: something that has been conspicuously missing from a lot of it for some time now.Author Andy Weir has written a gritty, compelling story of an astronaut marooned on Mars, with little or no hope of survival.  Mark Watney is a heck of a character, engaging in his first person view narrating his diary to us all.  It’s a story of hope, resilience, and enough humor to leaven any potential bleakness.  We also get other views, from autistic spectrum computer scientists to the other astronauts from Watney's mission who left him for dead.  All of these characters add something, and none are extraneous to the story told.Simply put, I cant believe this did not win a Hugo, either in 2011 or 2014 (it was self-published first and then picked up later).  Then again, when I have a look at the books that have won over the last few years, they all seem to have far fewer Amazon reviews than this - generally by more than an order of magnitude.  Assuming some correlation between reviews and sales, I think its safe to say that The Martian may well come out on top: its also being made into a movie, apparently, which I don’t think any of those others are (save of course 2011 nominee Dance with Dragons being the upcoming series of Game of Thrones)If you like actual sci-fi, read this.  It reminded me why I used to love sci-fi, once upon a time.

  Review 7*A friend recommended this book. Although I had heard about this book being made into a movie, I was a little worried about the hype and whether it would be worth it. However, I can categorically say that I LOVED IT!I decided to get this in audiobook format, due to time issues. R.C. Bray brought this story to life with his characterizations. I really enjoyed listening to him. His narration and diction was perfect. I would definitely consider listening to more books narrated by him.Mark Watney is a fantastic character. I fell in love with his determination and wit when he finds himself stranded on Mars, alone, after his crew members think he is dead and evacuate due to a severe sand storm. If I had been in his shoes, I think I would have gone crazy.I am a huge science fiction/thriller fan. I started to listen to this story and I was hooked right from the beginning. I can now understand all the hype and why this book was made into a movie (which I haven't seen yet, though I am now determined to get the DVD for it since it's no longer available in my local cinema). This is a dramatic, heartwrenching and hopefilled story. I am still slightly emotional about this book (can't you tell?).I love how the author managed to keep the tone of the story light, considering the darkness of the subject matter. He also kept the story's intensity high with dangerous situations, though with comedic results at times. The warmth and wit that he gave his characters made them lifelike and likable. The technical aspects of the story were dumbed down slightly for the layman and, although some of it did go over my head, I mostly followed and understood it. I will say, however, mathematics was never my strong suit, so had to take the author's word for it with regards to several calculations made. Nevertheless, I found myself riveted as the tale unfolded. As I reached the end of the story, I found myself on a roller coaster ride of hope, worry, terror, joy and happiness. I did think that the author could have ended it in a different way if he wanted to. I'm not sure if that would have been as well received, but could conceivably be just as realistic. I must admit that I did prefer the ending he went with in the audiobook, which I understand to be a re-imagined ending rather than the original. However, I cannot comment further as I've not read the book, so do not know if this change was made on the Kindle and print versions too.Andy Weir has written a fantastic space thriller. To say that this is his debut novel, it is a remarkable achievement. I love his fast paced writing style and the flow was fantastic. He's found another fan! I hope he's got something else cooking on his computer being released soon, and I can't wait to find out what it is.Due to the frequent use of justified (in my opinion) bad language, I do not recommend this book to younger readers. However, I HIGHLY recommend this book if you love a rip roaring science fiction/action/adventure/thrillers. - Lynn Worton

  An astronaut is accidentally abandoned on Mars after a storm nearly kills the entire crew. Can he save himself from a slow and cold lonely death?I read this book in 3 days. It zips along nicely and I always wanted to know “what happens next”, so why am I disappointed. Well the main problem for me was the distinct lack of characterisation, without this your characters lack depth and can become stereotypes. Our main character, because we spend quite some time reading his “journal/diary” does at least grow a little in our imagination, even if I never really “saw” him, however all the secondary characters at Mission Control and his former colleagues now speeding home, are little more than cardboard cut-outs and I never saw any of them in my minds eye. I was therefore never very interested in any of them.The Journal containing his record of events is at first interesting and different, however it soon becomes repetitive in the extreme. Explanations of what he needs to do, descriptions of how he does it, then how it all went wrong and how he fixed it again on nearly every page, you get the picture. It does go on a bit in this vein and the descriptions of “how to” in the end do get rather boring. After a while the regular inevitable disasters that “will kill me in a few minutes” are actually nothing of the sort. It's always quickly fixed with some sticky tape, a few dabs of glue and of course our hero's massive intelligence and extreme resourcefulness. You're expecting genuine human drama backed up by real danger and imminent death, only to be let down badly by an adult boy scout who “cries wolf” every other page.The writing is at best adequate for an adventure story, often not very interested in character development, but truth be told, those cardboard characters and the “The idiots guide to survive alone on Mars” really does kill any emotion stone dead. The dialogue, especially at Mission control, is clunky and often juvenile. Simplified scientific explanations, for the poor average reader who doesn't know his Co2 from his O2 are so very common, that some pages really have little else on them. Mathematical explanations about how long this or that will last pepper the narrative to such an extent that I got fed up and often wanted to close the book and forget I had bought it. His habit of including a “funny last line” to many “Sol Entries” also soon became tiresome. Expecting your reader to think a little is fine and there is nothing wrong with that, however it can't replace drama and human interest with “a bit of Science” because it doesn't work. The end, what we have been waiting for since page one, is over in a flash. The four or five pages of excitement and emotion free description of his fate, was just not good enough by half. It should have been a white knuckle ride, intense and heart pounding, but no, all we get is, this happened and then this happened, what a tremendous let down! The end feels rushed to say the least, when the author spends pages and pages educating us about Oxygen and Nitrogen, but can't put together a reasonably exciting end it says quite a lot about the authors ability to write fiction. He definitely prefers the technical to the human aspects of his story. What a shame. Even with it's obvious flaws I finished the book so what does that mean? It means that the author has taken a strong basic story that's been done before (Robinson Crusoe on Mars) and given it a makeover. In the hands of a more experienced author, with the ability to inject some humanity and real human interest, it could have been great. As it turned out it became a summer blockbuster in the vein of Jaws and The Da-Vinci Code, a huge hit, a film, but in the final analysis a bit of a disappointment.Let's hope the film can inject some characterisation and real human drama.

  I was able to watch the film shortly after reading this, so for me, comparisons are inevitable.As a novel, this is written in an easy-going style; it is - of course - science fiction, but of the type based on current knowledge and informed speculation. It is also a slow-cooked, long-haul novel rather than the microwaved ready-meal that is the film version. The film scores on two points – visuals and Matt Damon's performance; the book however, is a more rewarding affair, expounding the science, calculations, character motivations and mechanics of the plot.If your preference is for sci-fi where the character presses a button and the ship goes whoosh, this may not appeal; if, however, you want to know WHY it goes whoosh, this book will be right up your street. I don't like a lot of facts and figures thrown at me, but there was nothing I couldn't follow here, and the pacing, the dramatic twists and turns, were all well judged.I won't trouble you with the details of the story-line - there's enough already out there in the other reviews to provide you with the gist of it -  I'll just warn you that there are at least two significant plot omissions in the film and one change that (for me, anyway) undermines its credibility.While I enjoyed both the novel and the film, the novel is in my opinion the stronger medium, easily surpassing the movie version, and well worth reading.

  This story is pure science fiction, both funny and thrilling at the same time and one of those sharp story heavily laced with geeky details. This story will probably please most fans that are into hard sci-fi genre but may leave some readers questioning themselves whether this book was worth the time spent reading it…..The story follows an American astronaut, Mark Watney, as he becomes stranded alone on Mars and must improvise in order to survive.There is too much techno sci-fi, mumble-jumble for my taste and long passages where Watney calculates how far he can get, how much water and food he needs but what makes these passages digestible is how the author has lighten the mood by letting his protagonist muse about his situation as a space pirate using unconventional methods to survive (hilarious at times). Of course there is tension found, the pages are filled with catastrophic failures and risks managing decisions. The plot keeps on moving with one random disaster after another and Watney faces each problem as it arises with admirable savvy and technical know-how. The protagonist is an engaging character although I found his development to be rather static throughout his ordeal. No signs of emotional and psychological impact from the experience at all. The story is set in the present and is narrated in alternate voices by the astronaut, mission control desk managers, mission crew and by a third person’s point of view. All account is vivid and very visual….not surprising it is now on the big scene.I have mixed feelings about this gritty survivalist tale, sometime captivated and at other simply bored to death…..Although ”The Martian” may have an amazing story reading it was a tedious task at times.

  Believe the hype. This. Is. AWESOME.Upon hearing that the lead character is ""funny"", I was concerned. Hello, grave danger? Could die anytime? Mark Watney could've been very annoying. But he's not - his sense of humour plays a big part of keeping him alive.Imagine how different, and shorter, this novel could've been if Mark had depression, PTSD, or anxiety. You hear about a fight-or-flight response, but I reckon there's a third response: freeze. When you can't decide to fight or flee, because you can't think at ALL. You FREEZE.Considering his situation (being alone on Mars with supplies dwindling), Mark's mental health is astonishingly good, so he's able to think on his feet, which saves his life on several occasions.Pretty much the entire book contains a bombardment of obstacles, which Mark (and the rest of the Ares 3 crew in space, and the staff on Earth) must overcome - and quickly. Not every plan works, but it's amazing what can happen when everyone works together to save one guy.(And then you get down when you think of real life, and how people die every day, and Earth's people can't all get their act together to help...)Some have complained of ""too much science"" in the novel, but I very much appreciate every bit of it. Can I remember and relay any of it? No, but its inclusion means everything to me, because it proves how hard Andy Weir worked to make his story as plausible as possible. Would his plot points work in real life? I have no idea, but I was never pulled out of the story to think, ""That wouldn't work. Bad science! Go sit in the corner."" I read a lot of speculative fiction, and the stories that don't work for me involve magic, wherein the character wishes something, says something, and then what they want to happen does. I can never truly get behind those stories, but THE MARTIAN? Hell yes!From the affable characters, to the stunning ingenuity, the deadly location, and fascinating space scenes, THE MARTIAN excels on all accounts. But the real winner is the mind-blowing research Andy Weir undertook and used to make his story the best it can be.(Though imagine the story Johanssen could've had if...)

  In The Martian by Andy Weir spaceman Mark Watney find himself in every astronaut's worst nightmare - he's alone on a distant planet, accidentally abandoned by his crew mates in the midst of a raging storm that forces the Ares 3 Mars mission to be aborted. Left for dead and surviving purely by chance he has to make the most of his ample talents and intelligence to cling to survival on the inhospitable rock that is Mars. The story flits between Watney's isolation and tribulations on Mars, the crew of the Hermes which abandoned him, and the NASA experts on Earth who are trying their damnedest to bring him home safely.Watney is alternatively the unluckiest and luckiest man alive. First he is abandoned but manages to survive, against all the odds. Then a huge list of catastrophic events occur which, with a mixture of chance and ingenuity, he just about manages to escape with his life. Some of his workarounds to fix the problems he encounters are equally astounding and baffling in their implementation and this disaster/patching up cycle is the backbone of the novel and what keeps the reader engaged from start to finish. There is scarcely a wasted moment in the book and Weir has done a sterling job in keeping the reader entertained from the off.Even though The Martian deals with some extremely difficult scientific subject matter, Andy Weir writes about hard science in a way that makes it just a little bit more palatable and understandable for the everyman reader to digest. This ensures that the reader can follow what is going on without being baffled too often. I'm no expert myself but the science in the book and the solutions and workarounds Watney uses are apparently very accurate and could actually work soundly if this scenario was to occur in a real-life situation. What makes this all the more important is that Weir is no scientist himself, more of an space nerd and amateur science boffin. His research for the book must have been extremely exhaustive which in itself deserves plaudits.Although for the most part The Martian is written in an intelligent manner and there is nary a dull moment, Weir's writing style can occasionally be his worst enemy. For the most part the book reads brilliantly, but every now and again it lapses into irritating and juvenile internet forum speak. For an extremely intelligent scientist Watney falls into talking like he is frequenting a video game website comment section far too often, yay-ing and boo-ing successes and disasters and even abbreviating a complex scientific procedure down to 'pirate-ninjas' which, rightly or wrongly, really grated with me.Additionally, Watney's extreme exuberance can suck all the tension out of a situation that should have us sitting right on the edge of our seats. Even when the odds are hugely stacked against him and it looks like he's about to die he writes his journal with comedic prose and wry wit which comes across as a little unbelievable, if truth be told. Even the most together and upbeat person would show signs of cracking under the stress of being stranded on a foreign planet with no hope of rescue, yet Watney stays cool as a cucumber throughout even the most horrifically trying of situations.Still, the positives of The Martian far outweigh the few minor issues I had with the book. I can recommend it to anyone who enjoys any aspect of space or space travel. As a reader who has no huge interest in sci-fi fiction, I still found myself devouring this book at a rapid pace, managing to finish it with a matter of days. The last sci-fi book I enjoyed as much as this one was Rendezvous With Rama which is thought of as a classic - I fully believe that The Martian will find itself classified in the same bracket in the coming years.Overall a highly engrossing read that drags you in and, despite one or two minor foibles, tries its best not to let you go. Definitely worth a read and hopefully the upcoming film can do the book justice!

  Bargaining, boiled eggs, day’s nights, SF: some things I just prefer hard (you may make your own jokes).  Andy Weir’s debut novel, The Martian, could probably not be any harder SF if it tried – it is grounded in a glut of technical speculation and information, almost like a 370 page linear programming problem, which (while I found utterly fascinating) might not be your thing if you’re looking for a) some philosophical reflections on Man’s place in the universe or b) an insight into the psychology of a man stranded alone on the Red Planet.But, make no mistake: Weir hasn’t even tried to write that kind of a book; this is all jeopardy, all the time.  The detail in the plotting never lets up, with every single challenge met with ingenuity and credible compromises, every problem considered and worked around, often leading to more problems further on down the track.  It’s a glorious achievement, all the more impressive for being a debut novel, and, while the level of detail can get a little overwhelming at times, I prefer that to someone suddenly giving up on trying and just deciding with 40 pages to go that suddenly everything will be fine or a magic elixir can just be pulled out and applied in all cases.Mark Watney is a superb central character – resourceful, sarcastic, determined and fallible enough to stop him veering into superman territory.  The other characters may not fair so well in terms of full rounding-out, but there are enough beats and moments to see them as people, and really that’s fine by me.  Weir employs a variety of narrative styles to tell the various portions of his story, and sometimes the jumping from one to the other can take you out of things a little, but it’s not a gigantic problem; the consistency of approach he maintains is far more important, as I’ve already said, and the challenges at both ends never let up.This is the only other modern SF that I’ve found truly compelling besides James S.A. Corey’s Expanse books – typically my tastes fall more in the line of Aldiss, Asimov, Clarke, Haldeman, etc.  If that’s your kind of thing, this is your kind of thing.

  What a roller coaster life Astronaut Mark Watney lives! Thought to have died when the Ares 3 Mars Mission was scrubbed only six days into its mission, he is rather surprised to find himself still alive. Unfortunately, with only limited supplies and, thanks to the loss of satellite dish and backup systems, no way to communicate with Earth or his colleagues, this situation is looking somewhat temporary...And so The Martian begins. Initially, this feels a great deal like a kind of 'Robinson Crusoe on Mars' style book, with added science to explain just how Watney intends to survive the four years before a new mission is due to arrive (and how he will get to the landing site, thousands of kilometres away), but -Hang on, I'm getting ahead of myself. One of the reasons I found this book so enjoyable was that I knew almost nothing about it, beyond the description above. Unfortunately, to give this book true justice in a review, you need to know more than I've put above. Now, I really hate spoilers, even minor ones, so what I'm going to try and do is provide a kind of two-step review: the first part will be spoiler-free and provide some indication of Weir's skill, while the second will go into a little more detail. I will work very hard to keep the spoilers to a minimum, but if you want to truly enjoy this book as I did, stop at the point I say to.Right, where was I?Watney has very limited supplies, no way to tell anyone he is still alive and has to try and make it to the next scheduled mission. Quite how and if he is going to achieve this is at the heart of this book; a great deal of research has gone into pretty much every factor and what I was able to understand and check seemed to be accurate. There are clearly a few factors that required him to be 'lucky', but these are counterbalanced by some of the real obstacles and disasters that would likely befall someone in his position.The magic in this book is how Weir has managed to balance tension, science and plausibility in a strong and compelling story that engages and entertains right to the last page.Okay, that was the end of the completely spoiler-free zone. STOP HERE if you don't want any surprises to be spoiled.Pretty much all of Watney's story is told through his log entries, which can begin to feel a little slow after a hundred pages or so; but Weir is clearly aware of this and changes direction, adding a different viewpoint as NASA realise they have left a man behind. Suddenly there is an entire planet rooting for Watney to survive and an awful lot of people trying to work out how to make it happen. This part of the story is populated with a range of solid characters, some of whom only have small roles to play, but all of which are fleshed out enough to feel real.Having started out as a sort of 'Gravity', the story moves quickly into 'Apollo 13' territory, albeit spread over a much longer period of time. However, unlike 13, this is a fictional event and we have no idea how things are going to turn out: the tension is frequently ratcheted up as expected or unexpected events frequently try to kill our eponymous hero. And this truth is never quite forgotten: if the Hab breaches, he's dead; if the water reclaimer fails, he's dead; if he crashes the Rover, he's dead. You get the picture?This book could easily have been a mess. With the amount of science that has gone into it, it could have been terribly dry. The scenario is so beyond normal experiences that it could have come across as silly or implausible. And Mark Watney could have been a cardboard astronaut you couldn't care less about. But none of these happened; instead, Andy Weir has packaged everything together into a solid page-turner that had me rooting for the hero and going back for more and more.As a final note of validation, this book has been selected to be one of the titles in the UK's set of World Book Night Books for 2015.

  A six-person crew made the third manned landing mission on the red planet, but a severe wind storm forces them to leave just a few days after their arrival rather than staying for the planned month. During the emergency evacuation one of them is killed in a freak accident. The remaining crew members reluctantly take off back to Earth leaving their fallen crew member behind.The problem is that Mark Watney isn’t dead.The story is a fast-paced, compelling adventure across Mars and offered everything I wanted and more. I was behind Mark Watney the whole way, from the moment he wakes up alone with his crew gone, to his eventual rescue attempt. It helps that Mark is a great character with a hilarious dialogue; I warmed to him quickly and found myself rooting for him as I turned the pages. The humour keeps the story going even during the dull times. Thankfully, Mark is funny and Weir has the ability to know when the tone needs to be more serious. He also has the timing to get the most of his one-liners.Yes, this book is sciency, but it needed to be. That's what makes it feel so authentic. It's the kind of book that helps you to understand the importance of science. It offers a perfect demonstration of how something seemingly dry and theoretical can have practical applications, and even save your life, but it is so well-described and so well-drawn and explained that it doesn't feel like a science-fiction book at all.This is the opposite of a superhero book, instead of one man trying to save the world it’s about the world trying to save one man.

  In our crazy busy days, it is sometimes hard to find time to sit down with a book, and if you’re anything like me, if it’s a good story, as The Martian undoubtedly is, then the world stands still until I’ve finished reading it, often through the night. But whose schedule allows for that these days. That, coupled with a renewed decision to go for daily long walks instead of to the gym, spurred me on to find good audio books to accompany me on my walks – two birds with one stone, type of scenario.I have been wanting to read The Martian for a while and had it saved in all my wish lists. Then, signing up to Audible, Amazon’s audio books division, I saw it there and simply had to get it. It was a great decision.What a fantastic, gripping story, and what a wonderful narrator. I can highly recommend the audio book, narrated by R C Bray, a great acting voice.The story is about an astronaut who is stranded on Mars when his crew members think he had died after a horrible accident in one of Mars’s fabled storms. They leave, and he spends eighteen months alone on Mars.It’s a wonderful story of survival, and of how people pull together to save one man’s life against extreme odds.In our climate of reality television, this scenario is easily imaginable. But what makes the story even more remarkable isn’t his ordeals, but rather the astronaut’s sense of humour, his ingenuity, his fight for his life, and his growth as a human being.The book is chock full of sciency stuff and will appeal to science buffs everywhere, I’m sure, but it is told in a way that even someone as unsciency as me, can understand.I will be first in line to see the movie.Highly, highly recommended. A wonderful work by Mr Andy Weir.

  This is brilliantly entertaining, easily one of the best sci-fi books I've read in a long time. While it is heavy on the science, this is made accessible via Watney's pitch perfect, irreverent and occasionally crude and irritating voice. His log entries are equal parts pathos, wry humour and farting in a evo-suit jokes. It's a strangely compelling and winning combination. The fact that Watney is, excuse the unintentional pun, very down to earth and laughs at himself, often blackly, makes him endearing. I think in real life he'd probably irritate the hell out of me but I was rooting for him every second of the book. It's very hard not to engage with characters who show a winning combination of ingenuity, intelligence and grit, and in this case why would you not want to engage? It's an epic journey on just how far the survival instinct will stretch. In between we have brief postcards from earth as gradually the truth about Watney's predicament becomes known. This adds texture and varies the pace. All in all a very well structured and wonderfully adventurous book. Greatly enjoyed.

  Following an aborted Mars mission, NASA astronaut Mark Watney is left behind. His team think he’s dead. He has no way of communicating with them or with Earth The next mission to Mars is over 4 years away. Its proposed landing site is thousands of kilometres away. But all of that pales in significance beside the more immediate problem – Mark will run out of food long before the next mission arrives and will starve to death.He has a limited amount of supplies and has to figure out how he can use them in a way that will sustain his life, taking each day as it comes and hoping that a solution to what seems like a completely impossible, hopeless task. He seems doomed to fail and die alone on Mars. But the ways that he finds to survive in such a bleak and inhospitable environment are ingenious. He continues to defy expectations and relies pretty much entirely on his own logic and common sense to carry on.Be warned, there is a lot of technical detail about the systems for life support in Mark’s makeshift home, and a lot of maths and scientific detail as he attempts to work out how he can survive! I didn’t understand a fair few of the finer points, but it didn’t take anything away from the reading – as long as Mark understood it, that’s all that matters!The logistical ways that Mark survives form a large part of the plot, but what I found most interesting was the emotional toll that the ordeal exacts on him as a person. For the most part, there are no other characters present for Mark to bounce off, so he records the passing of time through a log.The author does a fantastic job of showing how being alone for that length of time affects Mark – he swings from optimism and excitement over the smallest of successes to extreme lows as he battles depression, isolation and malnutrition. He has very limited entertainment and immerses himself in work to fill the time, but occasionally things get on top of him and problems seem insurmountable.I think this book is also a testament to the strength of the character that Andy Weir has created in Mark. Although there are some sections where we find out what’s happening on Earth, for the most part, ‘The Martian’ is told through just one voice. Despite this, I was completely gripped the whole way through. Mark is witty and entertaining, and by the end, I was really rooting for him as he continued to come up against obstacle after obstacle.In many ways it’s a classic castaway story, but the barren landscape of Mars, the sheer distance of Mark from anyone who might be able to help him and the very real ticking clock make for a really fantastic read.

  A  wonderful book and quite a bit different from the film. However, it has the humorous spirit of the film. Please note that this review is written after watching the film so the characters are informed by it.The story is of course about an astronaut abandoned on Mars after his fellow astronauts think him dead. They continue on their journey home to earth while he survives in the habitat left behind. He now has to organise his survival given that Mars has no breathable air, no plants, food or water. He knows that the next expedition will return in 4 years time so its completely up to him to survive alone for that time. Its pretty hopeless at first but he finds he can grow potatoes in Martian soil with his own faeces as fertiliser. Its a rollicking ride after all manner of things go wrong but also after he figures out all manner of ways of fixing the various problems. The book is full of humour and very enjoyable to read even if there is a lot of technical details on the ways to deal with problems. A  lot of fun to read.

  I am a bit of a space fan. I am continually fascinated by the whole process of sending people into space and I am ever grateful to twitter for allowing me to see the photos that astronauts are tweeting live from space. Aside from this, I have not actually read many space stories and I am not sure why this is. I think it’s because I need a space story to feel realistic and not actually involve aliens trying to destroy us all. I came across The Martian when it was part of the Richard and Judy book club but did not pick it up until recently. I am not a statistician, nor do I have any great knowledge of NASA processes, I just read this book for the enjoyment as a spectator.The basic storyline is that NASA has set up a chain of expeditions to Mars but very soon after landing the third one, it is aborted due to a wild dust storm and the scientists have to leave. During the storm, one of their colleagues, Mark Watney, is injured and the crew assume him to be dead and have only a couple of seconds to make the decision to leave Mars without him. A while later Mark wakes to find himself stranded on Mars with little hope of surviving until the next scheduled mission. With the next mission years away, air and water are not the problem for him but he doesn’t have enough food to last that long. He is facing starvation on Mars and to make matters worse, NASA also thinks he is dead and he is left with no way of communication with them.Let’s just say, I was hooked.Mark is a character that I didn’t immediately warm to. I sympathised with his horrific situation and was willing him to somehow make it off Mars alive but, certainly initially, I didn’t actually like him. Whenever we hear from Mark in the book, it is written by him in the form of a journal. This way, we get to see his personality and thought process around things that are happening to him. He has a witty and sarcastic sense of humour which, paired with the good satire jokes, I found quite funny. As I spent more time with Mark, I warmed to him a lot.Mark's story to us changes from his journal entries, to the NASA side of the tale as word begins to filter in and NASA becomes aware that Mark is actually still alive. I felt that NASA’s reaction to the whole situation is well detailed and their plans and frantic meetings felt real. There is a real desperation to save Mark and we get the feel of the whole world rooting for him and it’s quite touching to read.There are many, many technical explanations that Mark gives us through his time on Mars and I don’t think that I could say that I actually understood any of them but this did not detract from the story for me. The book feels very well researched and the visuals presented mean that you can picture Mars - the cold, the barren landscape, the dust and the complete loneliness.My only real negative with the book is the lack of feeling I sometimes felt from Mark. I could only assume that if you were facing the rest of your life (and then inevitable death) on Mars, that you would have had more thoughts about this. Would you not contemplate life and death and question things you have done with your life or have thoughts of your family? All of this was missing and, coupled with the fact that Mark was consistently upbeat, detracted slightly from the ‘real’ feel of the situation. It didn’t need to be all doom and gloom but some thoughts of home or family I would have considered normal. Mark spent a lot of time on Mars but although the journal entries show how many ‘sols’ he has been there for, the time seemed to fly past and I didn’t really feel a full sense of over a year going by. Mark made no comment on his anniversary on Mars and I think that this made me not fully appreciate the timeframes.Overall, I was hooked on this book; it may not always be factually or emotionally correct but I felt it was full of action, provides good escapism, and is well written and definitely a page-turner. I read it in no time and am looking forward to more work by Andy Weir.

  That's the word I would use to describe the book. With everything that happens in the world today regarding space missions, this story feels so real. When I  picked up the book, I had a hard time putting it back down again. You felt like some guy really could have been alone on Mars. Where the author got this idea from is not hard to guess.The guy, Mark Watney, who gets left on Mars, is such a character. He's sarcastic, but so funny that you will be in stitches. I was, and that's tough since sarcasm is my middle name. The author wrote this character magnificently. Mark is so easy to like.Andy Weir did such an outstanding job of bringing this story to life that I can see why they made it into a film.I totally plan on watching the movie in the next couple of days. I hope they do the story justice.This is a 400 page book but I bet if you picked it up, you'd fly through it. So even if you think you won't be into this book, read it anyway.

  Having watched the movie and being a lover of science fiction I bought this book (I know I should have read the book first). It is MUCH better than the movie. The humour and sophistication of the scientific information given (I have no idea whether any of it is correct, but it was compelling to an amateur like myself) were lost on the screen, but beautifully captured in this excellent book. The 'diary' format used throughout is carefully broken up by various other plotlines seamlessly joined together.I also should say I got the audio version and thoroughly enjoyed the narration. While the British accent is dire (truly dire!), it is only brief - and the rest is brilliant.

  A smart, fast paced, edge of your seat rollercoaster. One man’s struggle, alone on Mars, all odds stacked against him, can Mark Watney survive the inhospitable environment of Mars?The story opens with a fantastic opening sentence which sets up the rest of this gripping story,“I’m pretty much ******.”As this sentence implies Mark Watney is in trouble, thought dead by his crew mates he is now stranded alone on Mars with the left over equipment designed to last thirty one days and his own ingenuity.Narrated mostly in the first person by Mark in the form of a mission log, one thing that really shines out for me is his amusing persona and wit leading to some laugh out loud moments throughout his story. Well aware of the position he finds himself in Mark is a very organised and calculating individual whose careful planning and resourcefulness might ensure his survival until NASA can be contacted or until the next mission to Mars, four years away.Using his botany background he is able to come up with plans for food, using his knowledge of engineering and chemistry he is able to provide enough water. These, coupled with the plentiful oxygen supply and endless stream of disco music to keep him entertained, survival doesn’t seem too unachievable. This doesn’t mean that Mars doesn’t have other things in store and with Mark using equipment initially meant for one mission on a daily basis over a prolonged period something is bound to give up.Although most of the story is told from Mark Watney’s perspective. Andy Weir also includes the viewpoints of those on the ground at NASA, his crewmates, who unknowingly abandoned Mark, news reports and some third person sections which greatly add to the suspense as they describe the consequences of Mark’s actions.Is it evident that throughout the story the physical and mental strain takes its toll on Mark, leading to moments of utter frustration and moments where you think he might concede defeat to the unforgiving planet, it’s also not just the planet out to get him but also his own human error;“Mars keeps trying to kill me.Well... Mars didn't electrocute Pathfinder. So I'll amend that:Mars and my stupidity keep trying to kill me.”Even with these blunders, Marks character and his resilience, mental strength and brilliant problem solving skills have you routing for him throughout. This along with his likable persona have you both sympathising with him and hoping that he can survive the punishing situations he finds himself in.I can’t recommend this book enough. This was a highly believable, intense tale of survival and suspense with humour and wit thrown in, hugely entertaining and I look forward to what Andy Weir releases in the future.

  The Martian, an epic story of what it's like to be an astronaut stranded on Mars.Mark Watney stars as the hero of this book, a botanist who was left behind by his crew. They thought he was dead. Mark certainly doesn't expect to survive: ""And it'll probably be right, probably. 'Cause I'll surely die here.""But as we follow him during his time on the sandy planet we realise that maybe all is not doom and gloom and maybe, just maybe, Mark can survive.The humour of our hero is evident throughout even as he is faced with difficult times and some tough decisions .I think what makes this novel as powerful and as compelling is the fact that Weir writes so realistically you can almost actually imagine this happening. Throughout the book there are moments of ""will he, won't he?"" and I just kept coming back for more.It is a bit of a geeky sci-fi, as many are, but it's just too brilliant to miss. A bit like a grown-up 127 Hours on The Moon for geeky adults who love science and all the mysteries of space exploration. Don't miss this gem and look out for the film!

  The Martian is a story about a guy, Mark Watney, that has been left alive and alone on Mars, all the other astronauts has left the planet, they think he is dead and he will have to try to survive until they rescue him…if they rescue him since they don’t know that he is alive.I’m may be a nerd in many ways but I’m sure as hell aren’t a science nerd. I decided to read The Martian after reading glowing reviews of the book on goodreads, it sounded so fun and adventurous and it was…it was also a hell of a lot of science involved in the book. I mean in the beginning I tried to keep up but after a while I just gave up and thought “no I’m not in school anymore, I will not try to force myself to understand things that I will not be tested for later.”But there are at least some bright spots in the book and it’s the humor for instance: “I was just one of her crew. Actually, I was the lowest ranked member of the crew. I would only be “in command” of the mission if I were the only remaining person. What do you know? I’m in command.”At least the ending was good and intense. So if you’re looking for a space novel and are not afraid of science, chemistry or math (shuddering) then you will love this book.Btw, the guy in the cover doesn’t he look like Val Kilmer? A young Val Kilmer…

  I watched the film first and got the book for xmas.  I loved both.  It was great to watch the film as I think they stayed true to Mark Watney's character but the book explained all the science behind the decisions he took, how he worked it out, how he tested stuff so it was really interesting finding out why he had to do things the way he did and how he overcame problems with science.  Brilliant, engaging, interesting, a great read.

  A near future set science fiction novel. It runs for three hundred and sixty nine pages. It's divided into twenty six chapters.It's also complete and self contained in one volume, and not part of any series or trilogy.The Martian is the story of Mark Watney. An astronaut on a mission to Mars. Presumed dead in an accident when the rest of his crew are forced to leave the planet. But he survived after all.Which might not be the best situation for him. Since he's alone on Mars. With no way to signal Earth. Living in a very fragile base. With very limited supplies.Good job he's a very smart man. And, like all living things, has the overpowering urge to survive...Watney's story is related via log entries. These can be quite short at times, and each has a heading showing when he made it. These all divide the chapters up into shorter sections.Naturally it means they're all in the first person. And they give a lot of detail. Which is heavy on the science. But never overbearing. It tries to avoid just being science and exposition by having him react in a very human manner to his situation with humour and various other personal comments.These opening sections do impress with the depth of research, as all the science is so very convincing. But they do take a little while to get into and get used to, so the first forty pages or so can proceed rather slowly. The fact that it's giving you so much information does also mean it's not prose that you can skim. The style does take a while to get used to.However the book really clicks after that because it does open the situation out. A whole volume of nothing but the log entries might have gotten heavy going. So the story then starts to flash back and forth across the solar system, bringing in people on Earth and how they react to the situation. Plus the rest of the crew of his expedition.There's an interesting cast of other characters. Once they're involved, the book does get quite gripping as all are working against incredible odds towards the same goal. But the nature of the writing does make their sections just a tiny bit more involving.Said nature of writing does just stop this from being a five star volume. It's not the most sophisticated of prose by any means, and it can be a bit rough around the edges writing wise. With some reasonable if not exceptional characterisation.But there are moments where the drama really does hook.A very involving story. And a very impressively researched one. Just one that is stopped from being a five star read by writing that could be a little stronger. Nevertheless, it is a good read and one that will stay with you for a while. So it's well worth a look.

  I can completely understand why it was voted the best science fiction book of 2014 by goodreads users. It’s an engaging rollercoaster of a story. The main character is left behind on Mars when his mission is scrubbed because of a massive storm that threatens to destroy their ascent vehicle. The wind blows part of the comms array into him, knocking him unconscious and destroying the bio-monitor in his suit. The rest of the crew believe he is dead and take off before the wind blows over their ship.This is a story of overcoming incredible odds to survive, and you are left almost to the last page wondering whether or not he is going to be saved. Most of the story is from the point of view of the astronaut Mark Watney, although there are little patches from the middle third of the book from some of the NASA people back on Earth and the rest of the Ares 3 crew when they are told their crew mate is still alive. The story is full of detailed observation, the author has clearly researched what is needed to survive on Mars, and the sort of procedures that are used for space flights. This creates a high level of believability in the events that unfold, and the responses to them.As you might expect there are a number of crises. All of them are completely plausible, and shocking at the same time. You read wondering what will go wrong next, and when it does go wrong you then switch to thinking how will he survive this. This is especially true right near the end of the book, when I couldn’t quite be certain how it was going to end. I really did care about Mark Watney and I really wanted him to make it, that’s how good the story was. I’m not going to spoil the ending though, go read it yourself!

  Although I’m not much of an engineer and my knowledge of physics and chemistry is by now rusty at best, I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It’s a story of survival of the human spirit, creativity and problem solving at its best.In previous reviews I have commented on how usually we put ourselves in the place of the protagonists of the books we’re reading and wonder what we would do. I can honestly say if I had been in Mark Watney’s place (abandoned alone in Mars), I’d be dead.Of course he’s an engineer, a botanist and an astronaut, so he’s not your usual Joe. Even by those standards, he seems like an extraordinary human being as he never (or very seldom) gets downtrodden and keeps trying and going, no matter what. Resilience should be his second name.I cannot comment on how accurate many of the suggestions or situations in the book are (and I’m sure people will have as reference other stories, books and movies), although I know whilst I was reading it, it seemed well constructed, plausible, and to my untrained eye the story felt true.I found the epistolary (logs) style appropriate and suited to the content (this is not somebody trying to write a novel or a confessional), the book thrilling, and the adventures of this modern day Robinson Crusoe gripping and impossible to put down.Do we get to know much about Mark? Probably not, other than his steel determination, his sense of humour (somewhat infantile, but hey, whatever helps) and his resourcefulness. There is no much character development, but maybe survival is far too consuming an activity to allow for much of anything else. We know the other characters more through their actions than through deep psychological insights, but this is an adventure book and it focuses on doing.We can’t help but ask ourselves if in real life the team around him and the whole world would have been so generous. One seriously wonders, but there are wonderful examples of human generosity and we can only hope so.Having had a quick look at the negative reviews I observed that many people said it read like an instructions manual and it was boring. Although it’s not the most emotionally engaging book I’ve ever read, I didn’t find it slow or boring, just the opposite. But maybe it’s me. And it seems a few other people. I’d recommend it to anybody who finds the premise interesting, but just in case have a look inside and read a sample, as the style does not change much and if you don’t like the beginning you might not get along with the book.I got a free copy from the Publisher at Net Galley

  Mark Watney is one of the astronauts on the Ares 3 mission to Mars.  Unfortunately, when the Ares 3 mission leaves, Mark is left behind, presumed dead.  The fact that he isn’t dead comes as a bit of shock to him at first, and then he is left pondering how, or even whether, he can survive.  He knows there is another mission planned but calculating his food supplies and other equipment he doesn’t believe he can survive until the Ares 4 mission lands, and even if he does the scheduled landing site is far away; how could he even get there if he is still alive?  Keeping a detailed log of his days on Mars he struggles to set up some way firstly to keep himself alive, and only then does he consider communications.  Can he contact anyone?  What can they do to help him, even if he gets through?In between, Mark attempts to keep his spirits up; each of the astronauts had personal music, movies, tv series on entertainment systems, so Mark can keep himself entertained wondering why Sherrif Rosco doesn’t just go to the Duke farm and arrest the boys when they’re not in the General Lee.  It’s not until we’re about 50 pages into the book that we leave Mark’s log entries temporarily, to go to Earth, where at Mission Control they are commemorating his death.  From there, the book alternates between both locations.I really liked Mark as a character; he’s clearly intelligent; a botanist and an astronaut, he has the know-how and is enough of a geek to give things a go; after all, he has nothing to lose and everything to gain if he can find ways to survive.  He has an irreverent sense of humour and this comes across in his log entries.  Having never been stranded on Mars, I have no idea how it may impact on a person’s mindset; but I felt that the log entries Mark creates are indicative of a man who is a survivalist, but has a touch of pragmatism in him as well.  I don’t really know why some reviewers have complained about the bad language in the book; there really wasn’t very much so that it became an issue, and I think I’d swear if I was stranded on a planet that was doing its darnedest to kill me too.  It seems to me that some reviewers have not taken into account the mental, emotional and physical strain that we have to imagine the character undergoing in this situation, coupled with his sheer will to survive and prove the odds wrong.I thoroughly enjoyed this book; following Mark’s log entries explaining his thinking through solutions to his problems.  I think these log entries were partly a way for Mark to ‘think out loud’ as he worked through each issue and as such they give us a really good view into his mindset.  I found myself cheering with each triumph, and feeling crushed with each blow.  The incident with the airlock some way into the book nearly made me weep with frustration.  A great book; I can’t wait for more books by this clearly talented author who has written what I found to be an intelligent and thought-provoking sci-fi novel.

  I'd give it three and a half stars if Amazon allowed, because 4 is up there with the best but 3 is just so-so. It's a bit better than that, and I really couldn't stop reading until I knew how it ended, but bits in the middle were pretty boring. Maybe if I was a more practical sort of person then the details of how he rigs up electrical equipment or drills holes would be more gripping, and I suppose this might be just the sort of book for a practical person who didn't often read much. I finished it on a plane, and the woman sitting next to me was a chemist who had read it and thought it was wonderful. The nerds are the real heroes of this book, and it is nice to see scientists and engineers celebrated.It did remind me of Robinson Crusoe (I only noticed after I'd finished it that the FT called ""Gravity meets Robinson Crusoe""), but not entirely in a good way. RC has lots of practical detail in it too, and I couldn't help skipping much of that. Of course, RC is also about setting out a philosophy of human nature, and the practical details are there to make it seem like that's a common sense, naturally observed philosophy. I'm not so sure the same is going on here - except in terms of the triumph of human ingenuity to solve problems by reducing them to technical ones. Is there a climate change agenda here? After all, the hero is stuck in an inhospitable climate but survives due to his technical prowess and scientific knowledge, until he is rescued by a huge engineer-sourced technical fix. Maybe...

  Mark Watney is part of a six man mission to Mars, the plan is to spend thirty days on the planet carrying out various experiments but just six days into the mission a major storm changes their plans and they have to evacuate. Unfortunately Mark has an accident as they're leaving and the others, presuming he's dead, are forced to leave him behind. Now Mark is trapped, completely alone on a planet over 50 million miles from home with no way to contact Earth. He's in a habitat that's only designed for short term use and he only has enough supplies to last a year (and that's if he rations them!). That might not be so bad if the next mission from Earth wasn't four years away but as things stand he's completely screwed.What follows is a bit like Robinson Crusoe on Mars only Mark's chances of survival are much, much lower, in fact he's facing pretty impossible odds whichever way you choose to look at things. The good news is that Mark is well trained, he's a mechanical engineer and a botanist which might just save his life. If Mark can figure out a way to grow crops on a planet with no soil he might be able to make enough food to stay alive long enough for a rescue mission to reach him. Of course it's not quite as simple as that and there are lots of other issues to deal with but food has got to be one of the top priorities.The Martian is one of my favourite books of 2015, I wanted to read it after seeing trailers for the movie but I had no idea how much I'd end up loving it. Mark's story captured me from the very first page and I absolutely devoured it. The main part of the book is told in the form of Mark's daily mission logs but as we get further along and people on Earth realise he survived the initial accident we start to see what's happening at the NASA base and how they are doing their best to rescue him. It's funny because The Martian is quite a science heavy story which isn't usually the kind of thing that appeals to me but the science is told in such a straightforward and personable manner that I didn't find it at all overwhelming. In fact I was just fascinated by Mark's thought processes and the various tasks and goals he set himself in order to survive.Mark's a great narrator, he's in this horrendous situation with very little chance of actually surviving but he still manages to keep his sense of humour and I was surprised how many times I laughed while reading this book. Nothing quite goes to plan for him though, every time he solves one problem and thinks he has things figured out something will happen that throws everything back up in the air again. Mars is an incredibly hostile environment and I think the planet is trying to tell him something - humans just aren't meant to survive out there.Considering I picked this book up on a whim to read before the movie came out I'm still surprised by how much I loved it but it's a story I'd recommend to everyone. There was just something about it that completely caught my attention and I loved every minute of it. While I'm on the subject of the movie I thought they did an excellent job with the adaptation. Obviously it doesn't follow the story 100% but movies never do, it included all of the major plot points though and more importantly it captured the feel of the book. The special effects are phenomenal and I loved Matt Damon's portrayal of Mark. Both the book and the movie are well worth checking out, personally I'd recommend reading the book first but I think that pretty much goes without saying!

  I still haven't watched the film but I enjoyed reading this as I travelled to work earlier in the year.  I suspect that, were I not commuting, I might have found it less interesting because there was, by necessity , more exposition than I usually like.  But of course, without that exposition, this would be just a piece of science fiction which might still be an accurate portrayal of one man's survival on an alien world but might not seem as real as it actually did.The obstacles come at just the right time to increase the level of excitement and despite who plays the central character in the film, we begin to worry about whether or not he will survive.

  This is real science fiction - no fantasy elements, no little green men but just a situation which could exist given what we know now. I'm not a scientist so I can't absolutely guarantee that the science and technology in this book is accurate but it FEELS accurate, is consistent within itself and actually is very similar to what is described in Chris Hadfield's excellent book ""An Astronaut's Guide to Life on Earth"". A lot about this book reminded me of the science fiction of Robert Heinlein, Isaac Asimov and Arthur C Clarke but definitely with a lighter style.This book has one of the great beginnings. Mark Watney is left stranded on Mars after the rest of his expedition has to evacuate quickly - they think he is dead. His log is the story of how he is going to survive when completely cut off from everyone and with no communication - he is dependent on his life support systems, he doesn't have enough food and no one else is scheduled to visit the planet for four years. This book is about how he resolves those issues, aided on occasion by the folks back on earth. I've seen this book described as ""nerd in space"" and certainly there is a lot of problem solving (even using duct tape so you can see how realistic it is). If you liked the bits in the Apollo 13 film when they had to resolve issues by cutting up the cover of their flight manual and using that material then you are going to love this.What makes the book a gripping read, however, is Watney's narrative voice. He is capable but irreverent. Some of his comments made me laugh out loud - there is a running gag that all the music he can find to listen to is an ex-colleague's collection of disco music (which rather gives us an insight as to what the film's soundtrack will be - Watney concludes that his theme song will be ""Staying Alive"" by the Beatles which gives you an impression of the book when you compare it to the ""Blue Danube Waltz"" of ""2001""). He tackles problems, adjusts to his situation and even writes letters to his departed crewmates. In between Watney's log entries are bits of the story from the point of view of those on earth and the crew that left him as they too try to solve the problem of how to get him back. Thankfully the author avoids any bits from teh point of view of his waiting family and there is no wife/girlfriend figure to tear at the emotions - this is Watney's story.I could not put this book down. I was absolutely gripped. On occasions I was tearful and on others I laughed. This is the ultimate feel good/triumph over tragedy novel.

  I am not going to go over the synopsis of this book, that's been done to death in all the other reviews. Short and sweet from me!This book is the best book I have read in recent years. I read the in 2 days, I just couldn't put it down. It is a fantastic story of survival against all the odds. I have heard (and read) it described as Robinson Crusoe on Mars and yes, it is. The emotion builds for the reader from the very beginning, you just can't help but feel the plight of Mark Watney (and the crew that left him behind).The story is well worked bringing in the crew on Earth trying to return their lost astronaut home. It is a great story and it is refreshing to see science fiction actually contain some science! From fertilising the harsh martian soil to creating water from scratch, it's just such a good read.Oh and there is a great element of humour in the book as well which I certainly related to!Now to find some more similar titles.

  The Martian is a 'Hard Sci-Fi' novel which means there is a very strong emphasis on scientific accuracy and technical detail. If you are a science Geek then no doubt you will love it. I found it to be an absolute page turner. Even with the force of Earth' gravity, I couldn't put the book down! Now it doesn't mean the science in the book cannot be challenged (as some NASA experts did when talking about real storms on Mars) but it is nonetheless very accurate and NASA did like the book. How to grow plants in a soil without any bacterias? How to make water? How to try and communicate with Earth? How not to die when everything around you is trying to kill you? All in all, this is one of the best novel I have read in years.

  In space no one can hear you scream, so they say, in Mark Watney's case this is good as complaining loudly about disco music and seventies sitcoms in decidedly not macho astronaut behaviour.Mankind has travelled to Mars and has finally set foot upon the barren red planet, two journeys and stays upon this inhospitable neighbour of ours have gone like clockwork until the crew of Aeres 3 wake up on Sol 6 and discover a sandstorm with incredibly high winds heading straight for them, the crew of 6 evacuate but on the way one of them is fatally injured, the rest have no option but to continue without him to the safety of their ship in orbit, the Hermes.Except their crew member is not dead, injured yes but Mark Watney is still very much alive and now all alone a long long way from home.The Martian is mainly told from Mark's POV in a diary style, each Mars day is a Sol, this book starts on Sol 6 the day of the storm and it captures Mark's unbelievable quest to stay alive, he has no way to communicate with Earth after the equipment being damaged in the storm, he needs to figure out how long he has till he runs out of everything.Now the thing is if I was stuck on an planet by myself I'd probably go crazy but Mark is just amazing, he is an astronaut but he is also a botanist and a engineer, and with those skills he is able to prolong the duration of his time. He does it with such a good natured outlook, his humour saves him from going mad.He has access to rovers, spacesuits, everything he could possibly need (except a rocket to take him home) and with these tools he starts exploring this vast planet, he knows probes have been sent to Mars before, he knows where they have landed, if he can get to them he could communicate with Earth.On Earth, NASA are relived that the 5 crew members are safe and Mark Watney is hailed as a Hero, commemorative stamps are issued, schools will be named after him but that all changes when a satellite picks up the red planet and unusual things are spotted, signs that Mark is still alive, the team focus all their energies on seeing what he is doing, will they be able to contact him and will they be able to bring him home?Well I won't tell you what happens but this book is just a pure breath of fresh air, space is such an inhospitable, dangerous, scary place but Mark makes it seem just a little easier to bear, there is a lot of science in this book explaining all the bits and bobs he needs to do to survive but I really enjoyed it, the explanations of all of these processes really adds to this books incredibly smart read.The Martian is funny, smart, thrilling and most of all human, Mark talks about everything from the problem of going to the toilet in a bag, how to plant potatoes on Mars and how not to blow up things by mistake!It never slows down, it grips you and as it nears its amazing climax you can feel yourself urging Mark along, oh and it has a map, maps are good!!!Read it!!Awarded 5 out of 5

  A good friend (who apparently knows me better than I know myself)  urged me to read this. I was reluctant as it is not my preferred genre but I have to admit it is nothing short of brilliant.This book is a hard sci-fi novel in the likes of Arthur C. Clarke. It's also about human ingenuity. And boy, you can't help but root for the underdog.Though the book is billed as a ""survival thriller"", I found the driving force of the book isn't tension, but of humor. The Martian makes the tale of an engineer stranded on the red planet gripping.It's full of action with humor at unexpected moments.

  This is without doubt the best sci-fi book written by an independent author I've read so far. I really enjoyed it from start to finish. It is the story of an astronaut stranded on Mars, presumed dead and left behind by the rest of the crew. Wounded and with few resources, Mark Watney, must find a way to survive in a desert and hostile planet.The words with which the novel opens delineate the tone immediately. We are faced with the irony of a character that has nothing to lose and finds in himself, also thanks to its scientific expertise, the strength to fight for his own survival.The story starts with an assumption which is not correct, i.e. a sandstorm has forced the crew to abort the mission. This is impossible given that the Martian atmosphere is so thin that, even in case of strong winds, these are not able to cause any damage, beside covering everything with powder. But this is fiction, not reality.With the suspension of disbelief the story begins, and from that point on it is a succession of brilliant stunts. Mark is from time to time to face new challenges and find improbable, but not impossible solutions. At the same time you follow the action on Earth, at the mission control, where at the beginning the protagonist is believed to be dead. Here, too, the irony rules. Several times I laughed out loud while reading. The dialogues are withering. Same for the diary of Mark, which is at times hilarious, almost as if the protagonist, trying to deal with fear for his condition, jokes about it, according to a custom typical of American films and TV series.The result is a really beautiful hard sci-fi novel.Reading the reviews, I found out that the author has published it in serial form, and only in the end he released the entire novel. I must say that considering how the story is structured, with a number of problems that arise and are resolved, it actually looks episodic, but I admit that while reading I had not realized it at all.The excellent work of Andy Weir, apparently, has been rewarded. The book was bought by a major publishing house and re-released in 2014.Rita Carla Francesca Monticelli, author of

  After an accident during a dust storm, Mark Watney finds himself alone on Mars. His colleagues in the Ares 3 expedition believed he was dead and were forced to evacuate the planet while they still could. The communications system was broken in the storm so Mark can't let anyone know he's alive. And it's four years till the next scheduled mission to Mars. Fortunately Mark has a few things going for him. He's an engineer and a botanist, there's quite a lot of equipment left over from the mission including the Hab - the living quarters complete with atmospheric and water reclamation equipment - and, perhaps most importantly, he has twelve potatoes. And most of all he has the determination to survive...This is a fantastic adventure story set in the near future. It's not really sci-fi in that all the science and equipment is pretty much stuff that's available now - and though it's chock full of science and technology, it's presented in a way that makes it not just interesting but fun. Mark is a hero of the old school - he just decides to get on with things and doesn't waste time angsting or philosophising. And he's got a great sense of humour which keeps the whole thing deliciously light-hearted. It reminded me of the way old-time adventure stories were written - the Challenger books or the Quatermain stories mixed with a generous dash of HG Wells - but brought bang up to date in terms of language and setting. And although Mark is heroic, he's a believable hero - he's a NASA-trained astronaut with a scientific background, so it's easy to accept that he knows how to make stuff work and also to believe that he is psychologically and physically equipped to deal with this kind of extreme situation.As the book progresses we also get to meet the people in mission control and Mark's erstwhile colleagues on the space-ship. Again, although they are shocked by what has happened, they show their professionalism by just focussing on finding a solution, reacting to each new development as it happens. So refreshing to not have to spend hours and hours reading about how they felt! There's a place for that in fiction obviously, but sometimes there's a place for a rollicking good roller-coaster of an adventure yarn too - and that's what this is.When a book becomes a huge runaway bestseller, there's always the fear that it can't live up to the hype. Fear not! This one certainly does! It started out as a self-published book which sold in the zillions, has now gone on to be traditionally published, and the film rights have already been bought up. Well written, though not at all literary; great characterisation in the tradition of the heroes of Star Trek, Buchan et al; enough science and stuff to satisfy the geekiest geek but explained simply and humorously enough for us technophobes to understand - and a brilliantly depicted setting on the surface of Mars. All the best sci-fi comes from Mars and this is a new one to add to that illustrious list. Put it on your TBR!NB This book was provided for review by the publisher, Random House Ebury.

  Mark Watney is one of the first human beings to walk on Mars. The chances are he's going to set a whole load of other records because, six days after landing, an accident results in his team taking off for Earth in a panic, little realising that the crew member they're leaving behind and grieving for is not a corpse at all. Far from it. And so Mark's journal begins.In a series of log entries, Mark records the Sol days and nights that follow his marooning, a Space Age Robinson Crusoe. But while he could be forgiven for falling into a pool of self pity, watching his oxygen, food and water drip away in a countdown to certain death, Mark Watney does no such thing. From the very first log, Mark Watney grabs his situation with both hands, demonstrating why astronauts are no ordinary mortals, and sets about finding a solution to each of his problems, bit by bit, day by day, setback after setback, success after success. Remember the scene in Apollo 13 where a life saving bit of kit has to be created from a sock and the cover of the flight plan manual? In The Martian, you have the panic and the glory and the worry of this on almost every single page.Luckily for him, Mark Watney is a biologist and a flight engineer. This means that he is not only a problem solver, he also has an almost inhuman tolerance for potatoes and this is just one of the many talents that sees Mark though these days. But what gives the entire novel and story an extra bit of tension, adding to the supreme tension of the entire situation and the precariousness of every single day, is that we have no idea if Mark will ever survive this ordeal. There are no certainties in this novel. It doesn't matter how resourceful Mark is, however much of a genius he is, however resolute and optimistic he remains, there is a big factor at work here that Mark has no control over. And that is Mars. This powerfully hostile environment never seems to run out of banana skins to chuck under the feet of our hero.The Martian presents two stories. When the tension reaches a stage where you think that you - and Mark - might simply collapse from the strain of it all, the action switches to Earth as people on that planet come to the rather horrific conclusion that they have left a man behind. From that moment on, the novel combines an account of the mission to rescue Mark with Mark's own account of his ingenious tactics to live long enough to be worth rescuing.The Martian is an absolutely fantastic read and without doubt one of the most enjoyable books I have read in a long time. This is partly because of Mark Watney himself. What an incredible character! A lot of what he works out, talking to himself in his journal, flies right over my head to be honest but that doesn't matter a jot. Through the intricate details and mind boggling science, it is extremely easy to think that this whole affair is real or at the very least potentially real. Surely all astronauts should read this? Just in case! It is never dull. On the contrary. This is science made exuberant and it couldn't possibly be any more thrilling because this is life surviving at the very extremes and all the time we just don't know how it will turn out. Any page could end in disaster. It's almost as if the author himself has no control over Mark's fate. It's all down to Mars.Another reason for the success of this fabulous novel is its mix of moods and tones. Mark is such a funny man. That's how he stays sane. But we can see through the laughs. Everything has to be worked out precisely. Death is never more than one mistake away. Mark can laugh about it but despair can't be too far off. Alongside Mark's state of mind we have the mood of Mission Control on Earth and that of the commander and crew who took off and left him behind. The pages shake with emotion, not least among them is guilt. And all the time Mark's world is vividly created - the vehicles, the habitat, the planet of Mars itself.I read The Martian on a flight with my Other Half reading it over my shoulder. On landing there was a scuffle to see who would stay up to finish it first. This is a novel to mesmerise and entertain readers whether you're a fan of science fiction or not. It is a tale of extraordinary courage and resolve and such humanity in the face of overwhelming odds. Anything can happen and it often does. It is a wonderful book, written with such deftness and skill, full of tension and drama but also rich in humour. I loved the central character, our marooned Martian, and hung onto his every word. I'm grateful for the review copy.

  Great book for any reader. Casual or avid.Took this on a long trip I had recently and it was a perfect length for light reading throughout the trip, I found it funny that I was reading it during my Layover in Houston which is where NASA is based of course.If you've seen the movie, the book will expand on EVERYTHING you seen in the movie, plus adding a lot more important things which will really help you understand the situation he is in a lot more and will invest you in the character, which I felt the movie did not do.If you have not yet seen the movie, read this first as you will feel smart when watching the movie, I sure did.

  I picked up this book at the recommendation of a friend, and I did not put it down until I finished it a few hours later.I've seen this book described as ""Apollo 13 meets Cast Away"". I would agree, and add ""...Starring MacGyver"". It is a fast-paced description of the year-and-a-half that an astronaut spends stranded on Mars, and the numerous improvisations he has to make to survive until help arrives from Earth.Admittedly, character development is marginal (though we do get to see a bit of each of the main characters' personalities, and some great humour). The star here is the story of the improvisations the hero has to come up with to adjust for each adversity after it occurs.If you liked the movie ""Apollo 13"", you will probably really enjoy this. If you are an engineer of any kind -- or just someone who is intensely curious about how gadgets work -- you will almost assuredly love it.

  What makes this book so good is that it is totally believable. The sequence of events, the reactions of the characters, the twists and turns - it all works to make you want to take part. I caught myself thinking that unfortunate occurrences that plague the hero are exactly what we describe as Murphy's Law in real life. In real life, if you were accidentally left behind on Mars, you wouldn't expect things to work like magic.The guy survives, to my great relief. He does it by extremely heard work, sheer stubbornness and a good dose of self-deprecating humour. He just doesn't let go. And people who save him don't let go either, take risks and prepare to sacrifice themselves to rescue one of their own.Great read and one of the best modern works of science fiction.

I dont care that the writing is simple, it was a hilarious read and i would recomend it to anyone who likes science, but also a bit of fun. The main character is witty and funny. The book is written in first person so you always know what is happening in his head. Whenever something goes wrong you are never worried that he wont survive, just how he is going to wriggle out of it, wich dissapionts some people but i fund the tenichal bits the most entertaining.

  I would recommend this wholeheartedly. Easy to read, ammusing, tense. It had it all. I have read a couple of the lower reviews, as you do. Some regard this as quite scientific and hard going.Whilst the character does talk in a 'sciency' manner, there are explanations of some of his survival methods which require an relatively analytical explanation, but provided you follow his conclusions, which are simply put and easily understood you will be fine. One of the best and most entertaining books I have read for some significant time. Highly recommended.As a side note I watched the film three days after finishing this. Bad decision. The book is orders of magnitude better.

  Not often you find a sci-fi (or any other -fi) book that has no villains, no violence or sex, lots of technical description and keeps you riveted from start to finish. Mark Watney, the man stranded on Mars, is everyone's hero - brave, cheeky, dry sense of humour and endlessly resourceful. Everything thrown at him, he finds an answer for, and its all totally believable. But the genius of the book is that he is not totally alone - the teams at NASA and his fellow crewmembers (who left him behind) are striving to save him by bending all the rules and finding solutions to every problem, so its a joint effort where humanity is the clear winner. A really feel-good story, now to see the film ...

  Having read some of the other reviews I wasn't sure how I would find it but I was riveted throughout. I am a chartered engineer and a keen amateur astronomer so I understood the technical elements and actually found that some wasn't techy enough! So the fact that some are complaining about the technical means it is probably pitched about right. There is little character development but the personalities of these develop as you read the book and you can form a background in your mind's eye. The book could have been over twice as long if it had gone into descriptive detail of the martian scenery but we've all seen the pictures from the landers and orbiters so, again, we can form an image ourselves.A cracking read which I thoroughly recommend. Looking forward to the film version.

  This was not what I was expecting! I was expecting a disaster story, instead it is a well written, upbeat tale of survival against the odds.I have to admit I read the book because of the film.  I hadn't seen the film but I'm not always good with space films so I needed to know the outcome before watching the film. In my opinion the book was better than the film, but then books usually are because they can tell a better and more rounded story.The storytelling was fantastic and absolutely hilarious.

  On a brief mission to Mars, the crew of the Hermes are forced to abandon the planet's surface by a vicious storm. One man is injured. One man is left for dead. But he survives. Mark Watney is alone on Mars. As luck would have it, he is a botanist and an engineer gifted with being able to fix things.It's hard to say too much about the story without spoiling the book - something they didn't seem to care about when the movie trailer was created. Suffice it to say that Mark endures all manner of disasters. NASA, in the meantime, are eager to try to find a way to get their boy back once satellite imagery reveals that he is alive. The problem is that he has limited food and oxygen.The book owes a debt to Apollo 13. Some of the issues Mark encounters are basically the same as the ones Lovell and his crew had to deal with. This does not distract in any way from the story, which is a page-turner. Mark is a likeable man with an extraordinary gift for thinking his way through disasters. There was only one point where I felt that he took a major setback a little too easily in his stride. That was in the latter stages of the book, so maybe he had become even more case-hardened by then. The good thing about all these disasters is that the reader never gets to settle in to a predictable story - new twists are always around the corner.The big question is whether this book is science fiction. I have heard arguments both ways. The science is plausible and well-described. I'm not a scientist, but I think I understood the vast majority of it. To my mind science fiction takes over from regular fiction when the boundaries of science are pushed beyond that which we (not me, personally, but mankind) can currently do. I think this book does go past that threshold, so I categorise it as science fiction. I know a few people who loved this book, but claim to hate science fiction, it being all about aliens and rockets rather than real people. It's their loss, so far as I'm concerned. The best science fiction books are about people, but are set in a scientific future - including this one.Highly recommended.

  Matt Damon? Hey, he has surprised me. Good acting. I didn't know the novel. I didn't know Andy Weir the author but after watching the movie in cinema unfortunately in German (I live in the province) I was moved and entertained. I read a lot since I own a Kindle, I have much more to read in English. German translations are boring and kill any life that a novel can provide. So I read ""The Martian"" in English. The movie was very good but this novel is outstanding. Andy Weir is an extraordinary writer. His novel was an joy to read and it cost me two days of my life. I read not very fast and I have sometimes to look words up. It was worth the time. ""The Martian"" is full of surprises, full of twists, full of suspense and full of humor.

  When I started reading the book I liked the main character's, Watney's, voice and enjoyed they way he was being inventive in order to survive. The technicalities of surviving on Mars are very clever but after a while they got tedious and I was longing for some narrative exposition and some real 'story'. The sections written in third person read like a film script and are only interesting for a short time. The book is long and about 150 pages from the end I was ready to give up. The book lacks the suspense that I think the film might have provided had I seen that first.  I've read James Lovell's account of Apollo 13 and even though the ending is well known I found that more interesting. I didn't believe that Watney was ever in any danger.

  Now, I'm no sci fi techy type. I prefer contemporary fiction and some fantasy stuff. However, the premise of this reeled me in. The book is chock full of technical information which must have taken an age to research, but it doesn't stand in the way of what is a cracking good thriller with more than a modicum of good humour thrown in.The only thing spoiling it for me is that the Watney on the cover looks too much like one W. Rooney! That slight digression aside, it really doesn't matter if you fully grasp all the science (and most couldn't I'm sure) what you have is a beautifully constructed survival thriller which stand comparison with any other. You even expect to see debris on Mars from his exploits when various unmanned probes circle the planet- it really is that convincing.Quite simply, a triumph.

  I have read a few of the reviews - good an bad - about this book and always I will make mine untainted by the opinions of others. Is this book a boring book with good premise, unexplored fully with one dimensional characters (as some would suggest)? No, quite honestly. It has been a good while (I've read a lot of books, even studied them at BA level) since I've read a book that has so completely engrossed me in both characters and story line. I don't think I'm considered an idiot by those who know me so I don't think it's me being stupid, or having low expectations, but this book gives such a sense of character with a man stranded on a planet that it feels very real. Yes, there is a lot of technical detail (beautifully researched I might add) but when you consider this is mainly in the first person, from the POV of a man with nothing better to do than think about how to survive - a scientist - who is logging his journey for posterity then why wouldn't it? Yes he does overcome his obstacles but firstly, he's a scientist, secondly he's a survivor and thirdly, what kind of a story would, Watney is a man who got left behind on Mars, ran out of food and starved to death, be like? The author has clearly thought deeply about the obstacles Watney has to face and how he could overcome them. The tension is terrific, even when he succeeds and even though as I approached the end I hoped he would survive (spoiler alert) I still didn't know if there would be a final twist and he wouldn't. I've read a lot of bad books usually disguised as good books under the all encompassing genre of Literary Fiction. This isn't one of them. It's a proper sci-fi book with an emphasis on the sci. Don't read it if that's not your bag but if it is do.

  There are a precious few handful of books out there that you just know, a few lines in, that you're going to love. I read the sample chapter on the Amazon page, had to read the rest as soon as possible and ended up going through it in a weekend (it only took that long because, technically, people do need to sleep).The narration alternates between first person (Watney's mission log) and third, when we jump over to earth to see NASA's attempts to first contact, then rescue their stranded astronaut. And, just occasionally, the narrative will focus on some random artefact and you just know it's about to ruin the poor guy's day.Mark Watney is not a hard guy to root for. He's intelligent and capable without straying into Gary Stu territory, darkly funny without being irritating, dorky and vulnerable and just so likeable it's hard to blame the human race as they follow each rescue attempt with bated breath.The book itself is supported by some pretty thorough research, and the information, while highly technical, is presented in a way that can be easily followed, so that while you understand what Watney's doing you can still appreciate that it's nothing you would ever have thought of, which helps to show, rather than tell, Watney's skill and resourcefulness as he needs every ounce of it to survive.The Martian is a great book that delivers exactly as promised. This one's a keeper.

  Foget all the academic criticism, this book came out of nowhere and is an absolute gem.  It poses the question: what do you do if you end up alone on Mars, when all your fellow astronauts have gone home?, having asked the question it then grips from start to finish, yes really!.  The reason is simple, unlike many of todays authors, Andy Weir can actually write in an accessable way that compliments a thouroughly enjoyable story that you actually want to read.  There are so many  writers in the SF world (hello David Brin) that attempt to blind you with technilogical overkill (still there David), whereas Mr Weir is the real deal, a cracking story supported by just enough (solid) technical detail to get by.  I cannot recomment this book to highly, if you like a good story (you do not have to like SF to enjoy this), love SF then you are in for a real treat.  CD

  When it comes to books, I'm a very light and casual reader, and don't read many story books to start with. So for me to read a whole ~400 page book in less than a day and a half is very telling of how good this is to me personally. It's unbelievable how gripping and thrilling the story was. A few of my nails are down to the bone. As you're reading it, it's honestly like you're there, and we've all seen enough space/mars films that we can fill in the blanks and visuals ourselves.

  I'm someone who enjoys reading. I'm also somebody who enjoys the TV/Film version. I saw the film trailer for the Martian and instantly though that this was my kind of genre. However, having seen the enormous amount of positive reviews for the book I thought I'd hear the story from the Book first, and then watch the film. I made the right choice. Without giving too much of the plot away, this book really is a must read. There's just the right about of action, emotion, and humour. Straight away the book hooks you in, with the stranding of Mark on this desolate wasteland. They then keep you engaged with humour (Mostly from Mark, which you actually laugh at and believe), and also the ongoing struggle for survival, inevitable set-backs, and then once more overcoming the odds. You cant help but like this guy, and root for him throughout the book. I have seen some reviews which say the technical side of things (working out how many potatoes you need to survive for 900 odd sols, or the amount of Oxygen which is needed to survive etc etc) area bit too confusing. I don't think this is a problem at all. I just kind of auto-piloted over the over technical sentences and the re-engaged when it was over- It doesn't take away from the story at all. (If Mark says that's how many potatoes he needs then that's what he needs!) As a little experiment I watched the movie pretty much straight after- I have to say that whilst by no means a bad movie (8/10 IMO) it pales in comparison to the book. You just don't get the rich amount of detail which you do in the books(understandable)- You don't fully appreciate the hopelessness of the situation/ the sheer isolation which you get in the books. If I was to offer any advice it would be firstly to definitely get this book, and secondly to read it before you watch the movie!

  A man is left stranded on Mars. To survive he must solve a series of problems; how to breathe, how to drink, how to eat, how to keep warm and ultimately how to escape. He has the equipment he came with, his training in engineering and biology, his ingenuity and his sense of humour.  Utterly gripping from first page to last. So much literature I read concerns humourless, over-emotional halfwits dealing improbably with the tiresome problems caused by other humourless, over-emotional halfwits. This is a about a hyper-smart emotionally-stable scientist dealing with a real existential problem with humour and panache. Yay!

Recommended to me by a friend, I bought and devoured the book within a day.  It's not written in an orthodox way either.  Mostly written as diary excerpts from the point of view of the main protagonist, but also with switches between different characters back on Earth and from the returning astronauts.Although not meant or written as a comedy book, there were moments were I laughed out loud as the author does inject sarcasm and humour into the book which works to add a sense of realism to the story.

I warmed to the main character and his style of journal keeping straight away, and couldn't wait to see how he improvised his way out of the various situations.If you want to read a cross between Apollo 13 and a chemical engineering textbook then I thoroughly recommend this book.

  In a book in which the writing ranged from very agreeable, to barely acceptable, The Martian can lay claim to making the point that man's survival depends on his ability to reason and take action, not an appeal to supernatural intervention. The story borrows from a number of examples from the canon of Sci-Fi's prior-art. It seemed to me, that one technical anomaly which was at the heart of the plot, concerned the viability of landing an MAV in advance, since Mars is prone to the sand storms that could cause an MAV to topple over, at almost any time, before a mission arrived :-)

  I came to this via the podcast community (Weekly Space Hangout) where Andy Weir was interviewed. I was amazed by the concept and went and got the book. What a cracking read, although how they are going to convert such an internalised conversation into a film will be interesting. The science is spot on or near as dammit. He keeps the 'fiction gimmies' to an absolute minimum its all credible and all believable and totally enjoyable. So much better than I expected and once again a self published work with no support from editors and agents.... and now a huge hit... come on publishers stop just selling chick lit and autobios give the rest of us something to read!

  I read this book in a couple of days. I thought it would be boring but far from it, My husband was surprised when I showed him what I was reading as this is the last type of book I thought I would ever read but the reviews were so good I thought....why not.  The guy stuck on Mars writes a diary and it was very witty at times, laugh out loud in some parts. You do have to be a bit of an ace in physics and chemistry to stay on top of alot of it but dont let that put you off, the author does try and put all the techie stuff as simply as possible. Its well worth the read even for people like me who are not in the least bit interested in Space travel.

  I loved this book! It had been sitting on my bookshelf for a while after the other half read it and I finally decided to read it before the film comes out. I was worried I might get a bit bogged down and bored by the technical aspect of life in space but the sarcastic wit of Mark Watney's character and the relatively simplified technical aspects coupled with the never ending challenges for Mark to stay alive meant that I flew through this book. Is this Shakespeare? No! But if you want to great piece of escapism to while away a couple of days, I would highly recommend this book.

  I read this after seeing the film, which I was worried about as I usually prefer to read the book first but I loved it!  Still gripped me even though I may have known the outcome (you never know, it might have been changed!).  Yes, there is some science but it's not that much - if you just get the gist it helps with the story but I guess you could skip it and still enjoy the narrative.  Mark Watney is a great character - but the story wouldn't work if he wasn't as he'd never survive on Mars without being optimistic and practical.

  I was put off this one for a long while simply because of all the rave reviews. When a book receives that much good press I usually find it a little shallow and uninteresting.And this book isn't exactly high art, but it has something - it's compelling. At least for me, perhaps that's because I fit the profile as defined so succintly by Randall Munroe in his xkcd strip - https://xkcd.com/1536/At any rate, I was sucked into the book and polished it off on a 2.5 hour flight.

  A surprising pleasure: even though a lot of the science went over my head I loved the drama and tension of Mark Watney's situation. But the main thing that makes this book work is Mark's personality: how you're immediately drawn to him and root for his success. He feels like a real person, and one that will make you laugh. It's the main character's likability that makes the uplifting, humanist message of the book believable.

  I didn't know if I would enjoy this book due to the technical jargon, but the story carried me through. Mark's struggle for survival is mostly told in diary form where he details his ingenuity, misfortunes and his boredom (his crew left behind a selection of 70's US TV). Comments have been made about the number of pages devoted to potato growing science and I do agree but readers should persist. Once Mark reaches Pathfinder and makes contact with NASA the story becomes more gripping.

  Great book - how one man survives when left on the planet Mars with not enough food and water to survive until he is due to be rescued. It is more about  the numerous technical problems he has to overcome by using his logic and his scientific background.Don't get me wrong I did really enjoy the book - it was quite un-put-downable BUT I would probably have liked just a bit more of the feeling of isolation and how he got through that rather than all the distraction of the technical stuff.My wife described it as a Geek's book - perhaps she's right...

  I saw the film first and absolutely loved it. There isn't all that much missing from the film, which is a testament to the quality of the screenplay.  That's not to say that the book is lacking - if anything it's struck the perfect balance between not enough description and too much fluff and filler. It's lean mean and jam packed with fascinating science.I think I've just talked myself into going back and rereading, which I almost never do! A firm favourite.

  Other reviewers have provided succinct plot summaries, so I'll just say that I haven't yet read the book, I'm 3/4 of the way through the audiobook read by R.C. Bray and I have been hooked from the first chapter. This is the first substantial audiobook I've listened to and Bray really brings the characters alive, I strongly recommend the audiobook version even if you are not an audiobook fan, it is the closest you'll get to a movie version of the book. The protagonist's sense of humour and resourcefulness combined with Weir's detailed descriptions of why each of the decision is made and the science behind them make the book for me. I'll buy the book and read it myself after Bray reads it to me and I'll be looking out for more of Weir's work.

  Like other readers, I can only recommend this book. Mostly it reads as a realistic story, it is obvious that the author either had a good source of inside practical information about NASA or did a lot of research to produce a novel that, at least to outsiders, appears just about believable. The story is gripping, entertaining, and the overall story-telling style gets better as the story unfolds.Why only 4 stars? too many swear-words, including spoken by characters whose real-life alter-egos would certainly never pronounce. It really made me cringe at times. Also, the author was still feeling his way as far as the style of the story was concerned, at the beginning of the book. Thirdly, I am very much in favour of good self-published books, but even they should be proof-read.This being said, buy this book, you will love it and regret that it ends so soon!

  The Martian is a good read - despite it flaws.  The engaging story is chock full of science and math that must thrill the sci-fi nerds to no end.  For those of us who are English majors, however, the countless equations prove distracting and disturbing, drawing away from what the reader expects will be profound emotional journey for our protagonist.  We English majors are disappointed, in the end, though as our protagonist manages to spend years (and years) in complete isolation on Mars with not a hint of emotional alteration, let alone the complete psychotic breakdown that solitary confinement here on earth produces in most.  He survives, physically and mentally in tact, on intelligence and gallows humor. Turns out, being glib and sarcastic is a survival skill in outer space. (Maybe I'm astronaut material after all.)

  I'm not a big fiction fan, particularly science fiction. Most of my reading is non-fiction, with a few novels here and there. However, I came across ""The Martian"" and was immediately intrigued, reading the first chapter or two there and then. It's an excellent story.To set the scene: in the near future NASA has established the Ares Program to send astronauts to Mars. Mark Watney, the titular Martian, is the lowest-ranking member of the third mission. A few days after his Ares 3 crew lands on Mars, they are forced to abandon their mission. Unfortunately, Mark is seriously injured on the way to the escape vehicle and is left behind, the rest of his crew and NASA back home believing he's dead. He has no means of communicating with Earth. He has no means of getting off the planet. His supplies of food and water will last almost a year; the next Ares mission is due to reach Mars in 4 years time. And so his battle to survive begins.Andy Weir has done a great job of making Watney someone the reader really cares about. Watney comes across as the kind of person you'd want to have around in a crisis. Not just for his technical abilities and inventive improvisational skills, but his upbeat nature and sense of humour. You find yourself really caring about him and willing him to succeed, despite knowing little of his back story. Despite his vast knowledge of chemistry, physics, engineering and botany he never seems like a know-it-all, possibly because of his many setbacks and near death experiences. I was crying with laughter at some points as he recounts his his day to day survival in log entries.I really hope that ""The Martian"" gets picked up by a studio and filmed. And I really hope Andy Weir writes another book.

  A well-researched and intelligently written book full of interesting problem solving. However, it's hard to care for the main character who never seems to falter, never consider the crushing isolation and depressing odds he faces (well he does but in total it takes up one page of the book).Too often I felt bombarded by technical information and calculations only sparsely interspersed by a cheeky wit. The characters all felt awfully thin and I didn't end up with a strong sense of... well anyone. The 2nd half of the book reads better as the protagonist runs into challenges that he can't instantly resolve (yet soon does). The ending was tense and exciting, however the rest of the book was a bit of a slog to get there.

  The amount of research and the depth of knowledge that the author has poured into this book is astounding. Not only showing you a seemingly accurate glimpse of the future of space travel but also showing you what would happen if it all went wrong. The best aspect of this book is seeing the story from both sides, the steady everyday aspects as the main character tries to continue staying alive with the occasional hiccup and the frantic panic of the rest of the world after realising that he's stranded. My one criticism is that the main character never really accepts the gravity of his situation and never despairs or shows any kind of respect for the situation he is in. Later I realised that this is what made him an astronaut, despite the jokes he is a fierce pragmatist. Overall an excellent book, at first I was slightly wary but in the end I was rooting for Watney as I'm sure everyone else was.

  I really, really enjoyed this book. More than I can remember enjoying a book for a while. In fact, if you are looking for an objective, balanced review, gentle reader, walk on. No doubt the work has flaws, and there are plenty of astute, articulate reviewers who will tell you about (I'm guessing here) the lack of examination of The Human Condition, how the pacing of chapter 3 doesn't match that of chapter 4, etc etc. Personally I had so much fun with the sheer pleasure of a good story well told that none of that registered. Anyone who has ever tinkered with anything to get it working, or to make it do something it wasn't designed to, or is just a bit of a science/engineering/space geek (why else would you be interested in SF?) should give this a go.

  Fascinating tale of a man left on Mars and his attempts to stay alive and NASA's confusion and commitment to try and rescue him.However, I found the first 40 pages or so difficult to get through as it contained so much (unnecessary?) detail of his attempts to stay alive.  All science, no humanity?!  In the end I skipped a lot of the detail.Interesting read nevertheless.

  Although this book spends much of it's time following the thoughts of Mark Watney, alone and trapped on Mars, it has a surprisingly fast pace. I couldn't put it down. Each triumph seemed to be followed by disaster and Mark Watney seems destined to never leave Mars. However, somehow he finds the strength of will to just keep going. There are plenty of joyful moments too, to keep the reader invested in the idea that somehow, against all odds, Mark Watney will come home.

  I'm a big lover of sci fi and this book was recommended by somebody who had seen the film so I really had very positive expectations of it. I'm sad to say that I got to just over halfway and gave up. There is just way too much indepth science to keep me hooked as although I have a pretty good understanding of physics and chemistry, this was far too much for me to keep up with. I think if it were written more with the layman in mind then it would have fared better. I found myself re-reading the science bits in an attempt to fully understand the gravity of whatever sticky mess Watney was facing but I'm afraid I was unable to so in my view it's not worth reading unless you've got a good grasp of science.It also repeated itself continually with Watney finding himself in an impossibility dire situation which he got out of by problem solving, cannibalising equipment and trial and error. Thus followed a period of calm and monotony until disaster stuck once more and the sequence of thinking and problem solving ensued. Up until I stopped reading this cycle repeated about four times or so.Not for me, this one.

  Initially, I bought this book based on the price. I expected a short story floating around the scale of ""interesting"". What i got instead was a hilarious, and at times gut-wrenching tale of one man's survival in the most inhospitable world we are likely to inhabit. For the price, I cannot recommend this book enough. The main character's wit really drives this story and gives some genuine laugh-out-loud moments. Some may find the more technical descriptions of his solutions a bit of a slog, but fellow science geeks like myself will find this to add a fascinating and well though-out dimension to what might otherwise be a bland landscape.

  You've read the blurb already, so you know the premise - astronaut stranded on Mars struggles against the odds to survive. And you've seen all the great reviews, maybe read that a film version is in development, all of that - so you figure this is a good book. And it is - good, that is. But it isn't great. Here's why.The book is divided into two - half is the tale of astronaut Mark Watney's time on Mars, and is told in the first-person. For the most part, this works well: the narrative voice is consistent, plausible and, crucially, likeable. The success of this book hinges on you rooting for poor Mark, and you certainly do. However, we are expected to believe that after nearly two years stranded on Mars, entirely alone (and without even radio contact for much of that time) that Mark would not start to feel the strain psychologically. And he just doesn't. At all. Now I've no doubt part of the NASA selection process is to find people who are psychologically strong and able to handle such pressures better than anyone else, but I just didn't buy that Mark would remain so good-humoured, so upbeat and not start to go just a little crazy after so long completely alone. Now I didn't want ""The Martian"" to turn into a psychological horror (I recommend ""Dark Matter"" by Michelle Paver for that) but it would have been nice, and more authentic, for some stir-craziness to set in.The other half of the novel revolves around activities on Earth, with NASA and its partners trying everything they can to re-establish contact with Mark, and then hatch a rescue plan. And this is where The Martian really falls down. All the Earth-bound scenes are written in the third person, and it's just not as good. In fact, there are places where Weir's prose threatens to become Dan Brown-esque. Never a good thing.Despite these flaws, ""The Martian"" is a genuine page-turner with a satisfying ending. This reader has been interested in space for forty years or so, and found the technical details fascinating - they add real depth to the story, but are not overdone (no-one need worry about handling the science content). On balance, they more than make up for Weir's occasional sojourn into Dan Brown territory.Amazon doesn't do half-stars. If it did, this would be a three-and-a-half star review. As it is, ""The Martian"" doesn't do enough to justify being rounded up rather than rounded down.

  A lot of reviewers complain about the technical detail, but the author uses this to make a gripping adventure story about survival in space. The level of detail makes the story believable and does not rely on a deus ex machine to save the day.  It is like Apollo 13 on Mars. Very real and very gripping

  As usual I received this book free of charge in exchange for a review, this time from NetGalley. Also as usual I will give my candid thoughts below.The plot of this one is basically Castaway plus any movie you've ever seen set on Mars. Guy's marooned on Mars and only has his wits to survive the situation.On the positive side the level of detail here is amazingly intricate and the author tells you every single detail of every cliff-hanging situation and its eventual resolution. Also, the main character is one of those rare individuals who responds to stress with humor so the book manages to be quite funny in its way despite the rather grim situation being faced.To the negative, the science in this book is OK but at times left me scratching my head in perplexity. It's obvious the author has done his homework but there were more than a few holes. For the most part I managed to ignore them but anyone who is hyper-technical will likely be inflamed at the whole thing. Finally, after a while the meticulous detail tended to be rather draining. I started and finished this book in a single 5-hour sitting and by the end I was just exhausted and ready for it to end. I highly recommend that you do NOT attempt that.In summary, this book has a great premise and pretty good execution for a book so intimately tied to science content. I also have absolute confidence that this will become a movie (if it hasn't already) so look for it in the theatre eventually.

  This is the book Heinlein would have written and Campbell published in Astounding if they were alive today. The best near future Mars story I have read.

Simply put, it's a nail-biter that'll trim your finger nail plates down even with the nail beds.My reading tastes usually don't encompass space fiction because the vast majority of it seems to fall within the realm of extreme fantasy with worlds and ETs of the most fantastical sorts. I prefer my off-Earth stories to have some plausible connection with realistic, albeit extrapolated, technology and situations, and the one book that remains embedded in my memory as simply terrific is from all the way back in 1975 when I was much younger and perhaps more impressionable - Arthur C.

  So, at last I have actually read this book that has received some major hype since publication – and I must admit that I did enjoy the read. Some of the comments and reviews from the Press and other publications have been perhaps a bit too OTT. Larry Niven’s comment about this being like Robinson Crusoe but written by someone brighter, all I can say to that is Larry please actually read and understand Robinson Crusoe.As a roller coaster ride of pure escapism and action this book does fulfil, but methinks this was written with a film in mind. There are many reasons for this as the style is pretty visual, and the characterisation is not fully developed, only the amount you would expect for an action movie. Being male of course when I was little I wanted to be an astronaut, like most boys, but there has to be something different about people who actually do the job, after all they have to take off with a lot of rocket fuel just below their backsides, which I suppose makes them to a degree into adrenalin junkies. I have nothing against astronauts, and not only do they have to be brave, very clever and intelligent, there are loads of other attributes that they must possess, and in this story you do wonder how Mark Watney managed to complete the training. I liked the man as I read this, but there are quite a few times when you wonder if he is a bit simple. For someone alone, stranded on Mars you do have to wonder what would go through your mind. Obviously there is the aim to stay alive, but you would also have a lot of negative thoughts, and contemplate on life and its meaning. For us reading this though, Watney never really has this depth of character, making him seem only partly real.Reading this I thought of the film ‘Speed’ which I love, but I remember when I first saw it at the cinema and when new events cropped up everyone would groan, and then laugh, so although things keep going wrong and Watney has to come up with solutions, sometimes by himself, other times with the help of NASA you don’t actually get bored, instead you end up thinking of what can possibly happen next. Andy Weir has obviously thought of Michael Crichton when writing this, as with both authors, if something can go wrong it will, it is usually down to people to put right the mechanical and computer failures.Where this lifts itself above other such books is that there is always a certain strain of humour running through this, and the author throws in some good satire, what with the politics within such organisations as NASA which rely on government support, and the Chinese space agency deciding whether they can help or whether everything should remain secret and they should ignore what is happening. Also it is amusing to see NASA going from solutions with all the safety factors in place, to things that are a bit more ad hoc. Certain elements such as this do make this a lot better than other books. Like the majority of people reading this I haven’t really thought about the chemical and mathematical equations and if they are correct, but I suspect at least one person has sat down with pen and paper and checked these as they were reading this, and it would be interesting to see whether the author is correct.As for a more deeper element to this novel there isn’t really one until the last few pages when we are made to think of all the people and all the organisations that help to try and save Watney, and how people help and risk themselves all the time with such things as looking for those stranded whilst hiking, or saving people from the sea. In all then although not the best written book, this is full of action and is good escapism. Does Mark Watney survive? You will have to read the book to find out.

  Don't get carried away by the hype, I have no doubt the film is very good; sadly I cannot say the same about the book. My hopes were high and it started promisingly enough, except it became completely bogged down in page after page after page of talk about calories, potatoes and more potatoes. At one stage our hero describes how he has to fertilise his crop with his own faeces. Well, he certainly shovels plenty of crap after that, but it's all aimed at the reader. In the film we are treated to the landscape, special effects and Matt Damon himself, quite apart from the supporting cast back in Nasa the director can show us. You get none of that in the book for quite a long time: hell, I'm assuming they sent a rescue mission to him in the book, I certainly gave up long before the end, but not before I skipped quite a lot of pages only to discover our hero still talking about potatoes. I reckon the Martian was such an annoying little bastard they stranded him on Mars on purpose.

  This novel has a great premise, which is in many ways it greatest strength. Weir is great at delivering technical information in his writing style, and a great part of the text is quite technical. But it's succinct, and is never bogged down with advanced vocabulary. However, if you are not looking for a story that talks a lot about the technicalities and issues of space travel and inter-planetary exploration, this book is not for you.The story itself is good, switching between the main characters life on mars, and the events of those back on earth adds a refreshing change of pace at key points which keeps the reader engaged. Do not expect a deeply philosophical approach to difficulties faced by a lone human on a barren world, you wont be getting it. Life alone on Mars is described by Mark Watney, a likable and quick witted botanist, who likes to keep things simple, and humorous.All in all, this book will interest the sci-fi fan, and will appeal to the casual reader, such as myself, looking for a new and refreshing story.

  This is the story of a Mars mission that goes wrong, and the attempts to pick up the pieces (I give that much away as it is revealed right at the beginning).It is an unusual novel as it is so well researched and steeped in realism - to the extent that nearly every page contains details of some calculation or engineering explanation associated with survival. I found that interesting, though I am sure some people will find it too much like a science lecture so please don't be misled by the high ratings - the reviewers may be people with a leaning in that direction.I found the dialogue extremely poorly written.  It doesn't ring true at all.  I  wondered if the book was written not by a professional writer but an amateur who just knew about space travel. (Checking on wikipedia I find this is indeed true). Again and again I winced as one of the characters said something unnatural that was obviously an explanation to the reader. Sometimes the author was even aware of it and made a feeble apology.  After one character gives a basic science explanation that was obviously completely unnecessary to the person he was talking to, someone says ""You don't need to tell him that - he's got an astrophysics degree"".  As though, just for a moment he thought he was in a pub, not a room full of NASA rocket scientists.  Then there's this: ""Do you believe in God?"" ""I believe in many Gods, remember I'm a hindu"". If the reader needs an explanation why someone called Venkit Kapur believes in many Gods, Venkit's colleague certainly doesn't. I am surprised this wasn't caught by the editing as it is really bad writing and there is a simple solution - put your explanations direct to the reader. By magic, excruciating dialogue turns into ok narrative.The monologue is quite well written, which is fortunate as there is much more monologue than dialogue.There is one other thing that struck me although I guess it was deliberate.  It is totally rooted in the time of writing and before. There is no reference to new technology or culture. People use USB sticks, JPEG files and spreadsheets and constantly refer to seventies TV and disco music.The weak dialogue slightly spoiled it for me but as the sense of realism was so good I still give it 4 stars.PS I don't want to be a smarty pants but given how well researched it seems to be, I was surprised to find a basic error of science. It isn't important but for anyone interested, here is the point.  Someone is talking about letting air out of a container to give it momentum.  He says that it doesn't matter how big the hole is because the change in momentum is the same.  Anyone who has studied fluid mechanics and thermodynamics (I confess, I have) will know that this is completely incorrect. The change in mass is the same but the change in momentum will be very different. Just try putting your finger over the end of a hose - the water comes out faster.

  I really enjoyed this book despite never really reading much 'sci-fi'. Previous reviewers have criticised the use of the technical language etc, but I genuinely didn't mind and could read 'past' it, enjoying the dilemmas and adversarial situations the lone astronaut Mark faced. I would recommend this book and suggests it's one well worth a read.

  This book captures the atmosphere of Golden Age of scifi when epic tales were told on a truly human scale and we could accomplish anything.There is no imminent apocalypse for humanity or forces beyond the ken of man, just one man's struggle for survival in a hostile, barren wasterland using only his wits and the latest in technology in a hostile barren wasteland.A really enjoyable read.

  Not so much science fiction,more a fast moving thriller that happens to be set on mars. The initial premise of an astronaut being left behind sounded a little unbelievable. But this is quickly resolved with a very plausible storyline, that has you rooting for the likeable hero from the first pages. The story picks up another dimension when more characters are introduced, trying to help our hero from afar. The most enjoyable book I have read in a while, will definitely be looking for more from Andy weir.

  Astronaut is left, assumed dead, on the surface of Mars.  Except he’s not.  And now he is stranded.So this is a tale of survival on Mars with our unlucky astronaut trying to find a way to survive until the next manned probe lands.  It is a tale of invention, ingenuity and a tiny bit of science.  But it is also a tale told with self-depreciating  humour and the science is generally told in a way that doesn’t make your brain hurt.Having said that, just as I was thinking it would be a long book of just survival and ingenuity, we start to get the aspect from Earth as they realise a man has been left behind and the full horror of the situation becomes apparent.It is a clever and original novel.  I will admit that there were bits of the science that went slightly over my head, but potential readers should not be put off my either my ignorance or fear of a science packed book.  This is about the will to survive and the skills and mental attitude that are required if you happen to be stuck on Mars.  It should almost be required reading for teenagers to not only entertain them, but teach them the value of science.

  WOW. I finished ""The Martian"" today and DO NOT RECOMMEND. Rarely (if ever?) I encounter such a narrative - it reads like a text book (and not because of all the technical terms and ""space talk""), a manual, an uninspiring and - oh God - so predictable and obvious piece of fiction. It's so clear and the pattern is so apparent that you almost don't have to read all the 300 pages to know how the story will unfold. Along with zero gravity, there is zero intrigue. Zero. Our man Mark Watney encounters various problems one chapter at a time, and he fixes these problems, sometimes in the same chapter. And so it goes. Talk about suspense. I think at one point Andy Weir also realises his ""one day at a time"" approach is way too boring so he jumps from day 211 to 376 at once and utilises this trick a few more times. Seriously, at some point I felt my state of mind was ""suspended"" waiting for a major revelation, imagining Watney being un unreliable narrator, making up some major parallel  stories, conspiracies, lies... Ah no. It's all pretty straightforward, with terrible dialogue and thought-process of a main hero that reminded me of a juvenile space wannabe. And don't let me start on teenager style ""jokes"" and attempts of humour (would the author ever tire of the ""disco"" jokes?).The main disappointment, second after complete disregard of Mars as the planet and all its mysteries per se (I mean - would not it be such a gigantic premise of all things sci-fi?! Scary, unexplained, terrifying, weird?!), was the fact that Andy Weir didn't deal AT ALL with the psychological and/or emotional state of Watney who is the only human on an entire planet living at the edge of death. Unless slapstick humour and cheap jokes Watney is cracking all the way is his evolved way of dealing with stress of being alone on the red planet (don't count the bacteria, of course).If you want a truly interesting and mysterious ""space"" story with great writing, check out James Smythe and his Anomaly quartet, starting with

  I didn't like the 'log entry' style of writing and wondered who Watney thought would end up reading his log.  If he thought his logs would be recovered by NASA, and be of use to their scientists, they would soon get fed up of his 'teach your granny physics' ramblings.It got to a stage in the book where I started skipping the log entries and only read the story from the perspective of others.Sorry Andy but I won't be looking out for future releases from you.

  Like Arthur C Clarke's ""A Fall of Moon Dust"", this is the story of escape from disaster without using magical science fiction but instead employing believable science. It is also quite humorous.

  Mark Watney is one of the astronauts on the Ares 3 mission to Mars.  Unfortunately, when the Ares 3 mission leaves, Mark is left behind, presumed dead.  The fact that he isn’t dead comes as a bit of shock to him at first, and then he is left pondering how, or even whether, he can survive.  He knows there is another mission planned but calculating his food supplies and other equipment he doesn’t believe he can survive until the Ares 4 mission lands, and even if he does the scheduled landing site is far away; how could he even get there if he is still alive?  Keeping a detailed log of his days on Mars he struggles to set up some way firstly to keep himself alive, and only then does he consider communications.  Can he contact anyone?  What can they do to help him, even if he gets through?In between, Mark attempts to keep his spirits up; each of the astronauts had personal music, movies, tv series on entertainment systems, so Mark can keep himself entertained wondering why Sherrif Rosco doesn’t just go to the Duke farm and arrest the boys when they’re not in the General Lee.  It’s not until we’re about 50 pages into the book that we leave Mark’s log entries temporarily, to go to Earth, where at Mission Control they are commemorating his death.  From there, the book alternates between both locations.I really liked Mark as a character; he’s clearly intelligent; a botanist and an astronaut, he has the know-how and is enough of a geek to give things a go; after all, he has nothing to lose and everything to gain if he can find ways to survive.  He has an irreverent sense of humour and this comes across in his log entries.  Having never been stranded on Mars, I have no idea how it may impact on a person’s mindset; but I felt that the log entries Mark creates are indicative of a man who is a survivalist, but has a touch of pragmatism in him as well.  I don’t really know why some reviewers have complained about the bad language in the book; there really wasn’t very much so that it became an issue, and I think I’d swear if I was stranded on a planet that was doing its darnedest to kill me too.  It seems to me that some reviewers have not taken into account the mental, emotional and physical strain that we have to imagine the character undergoing in this situation, coupled with his sheer will to survive and prove the odds wrong.I thoroughly enjoyed this book; following Mark’s log entries explaining his thinking through solutions to his problems.  I think these log entries were partly a way for Mark to ‘think out loud’ as he worked through each issue and as such they give us a really good view into his mindset.  I found myself cheering with each triumph, and feeling crushed with each blow.  The incident with the airlock some way into the book nearly made me weep with frustration.  A great book; I can’t wait for more books by this clearly talented author who has written what I found to be an intelligent and thought-provoking sci-fi novel.

  I read this book faster than I've read almost any book - I'm someone who often slacks when reading, but this I ploughed through. So that must be a pretty good thumbs up for the book, regardless of what I write next.In terms of the 'science', I liked it a lot. I could always understand what was going on and the author took you on the journey. Whether it was accurate or not, who knows! But he explained what the characters were up to and made a justification which to this non-techy's ears was plausible. For me it never felt too much.The downside is that it felt like it was written by a geek, a techy, so thus the 'human' elements are where the book fails. The protagonist Mark Watney is questionably likeable. I don't mind him, and with his flippant humour I was trying to keep John Crichton in mind from Farscape, or Dean Winchester from Supernatural. People can be flippant and likeable. But... still... Watney was like an American internet user author rather than someone who felt truly in peril.I couldn't get over the fact that I was reading a blog. Do you know how some American blog authors are just so totally enamoured with what they're writing, and they have to liven up *everything* they write? How a tale of how they fixed their hard drive becomes a 13 page essay about what they did, and what they thought, what their wife thought and who they talked to? Much like that. Conversations with Earth are like those oh-so-funny (not!) fake iPhone conversations you see online. It felt it was written for the blog-reading generation where everything has to be hyperbolic. As a consequence, the attempts by Watney to constantly engage the reader with rhetorical questions and asking if we remember something undermines the 'log' format. It feels more like personal letters.Which leads me to the main issue with the narrative. Hyperbole, lots of it! I know you're reading the logs of Watney but it doesn't ring true that someone would write and act like that. It would feel more plausible if it were a personal diary for a child that he had, or a loved one, where the amount of humour made sense as he fudged over just how bad it really was as it was for a loved one. Like malnutrition, proper health issues, where is any of it? Instead he keeps banging on about the desperately unfunny joke about disco.It's also very American. I was surprised at the spelling mistakes - it's clearly a UK edition - then I realised it was American English they hadn't bothered to translate. It then had just so many in-jokes, and cultural references that will go over a non-American's head.Then there's the swearing - or the cussing as the Americans would call it. I don't think I've EVER read so many variations of ""da*n"" and ""god da*n"" and ""god dam*ed"" and ""hell"" in such a highly concentrated form. It punctuated the text constantly. I'm no prude, but it feels like a prop to make the characters seem a bit more 3D. Which they're not.The characters back on earth are bad. They are walking action movie stereotypes. When they're not saying ""um"" or ""uh"", they're ""god da*ning"" and ""son of a b*tching"" each other and acting like idiots. The little lady Mindy is told by her superior male boss that he likes how she has an answer and is prepared for things. Another character defends her, saying she'll be upset by a man's action. Later a little lady gets apologised to for the ""testosterone"" in the room - because that's what we men are like! Women like Annie are just reduced to being swear-boxes while the men sort out the technical issues. But I shouldn't be surprised by the misogyny - when it's announced a ship is named after the goddess of rainbows Watney makes a slur about it being a homosexual probe. Nice! His comments about ""ghettos"" and bad parts of town can be read a certain way too should you wish.On the Ares 3, the characters are stereotypes. There's the German one. You know that because he says ""ja"" a lot, eats sausages and shouts in German. There's the disco one - ha ha, did you catch the fifty disco jokes? There's the other one, and the other one... all cardboard people.The thing is, as I write this review, I realise how bad it is - but this is because I'm analysing it, and digging into it... which it can't withstand. The fact is I read this book VERY fast and couldn't put it down. It swept me in, I eagerly wanted to see what happened next. It's an entertaining book.It's like an episode of Star Trek... not true grit, they'll find a solution for everything. You can't overthink it, or much like one of Watney's tents the fabric will soon start to tear.P.S. ""God da*n!"" Amazon doesn't give an age warning on this book, but flat out refused to publish my review until I censored various words. Those words are in the book, so that clearly means Amazon is happy to sell it you to without warning of content it considers offensive - but for content where it doesn't make any mighty dollars, then it suddenly gets a sense of morality!

Started well but just got into an endless rut. A problem happens. It gets fixed in tedious detail. Another problem happens. It gets fixed. Problem happens. Etc etc etc. The scientific descriptions drag on and on in almost endless detail. It is monotonous in the extreme. And the lead character is incredibly annoying. I think he is supposed to be likable with his dry sense of humour and can-do attitude but frankly i just wanted him to end it all about a third of the way in.  Who knows, maybe he dies at the end. I bet he doesn't though. The smug git.

  Andy Weir (2014) The MartianDuring a storm on Mars a NASA expedition has to make an emergency evacuation. During the escape one of the astronauts, Mark Watney, has an accident and is thought to have died and so is abandoned by his crew. This novel tells the story of Mark Watney's  attempt to survive and aid his own rescue and of NASA's attempt to reach and recover him. The story is told in the form of Mark Watney's log entries and third person narratives from the NASA end. This is a lot like the story of Apollo 13 but with much greater distance involved and all the problems that that entails.This is science fiction set in a near future that is characterized by convincing `realism' rather than flights of the fantastical. Much of the imaginative realm of the novel is focused on the logistical and technological challenges of both surviving and affecting the rescue. Watney himself is a down-to-earth character (a down-to-earth character stuck on Mars!) who is not prone to philosophical musings, psychological anxieties, or lyrical reflections on the aesthetics of the Martian environment - rather he stays doggedly problem focused and task orientated leavening his log reports with laconic humour. Likewise NASA has the same foci leavened with a bit of politics. Both narratives are convincingly told if you can maintain concentration on all the problem scenarios, logical solutions and imagined technology.Although the focus in this novel on matter-of-fact externalities rather than the internal experiences of the protagonists is not generally my thing I nonetheless enjoyed this  and consider it a commendable imaginative feat that it was able to convincingly sustain my attention on a  world of imagined space junk. I also quite liked the characterization, so distant from my own personality, of these psychologically pragmatic people facing terrifying odds with a can-do attitude of `working the problem' both individually and as a team in a logical, innovative and creative manner. I found this quite inspiring and strangely therapeutic.

  Going against the grain with this one, after seeing all the rave reviews I figured this much be so fantastic I have to read it.By 35% I was still bored with reading the daily logs and the science and engineering behind everything I could not do it anymore. It was like being in school in classes I hated. Even the logs were weird, written somewhat like a teenager at times. Bizarre.I know many say the book gets better further in, but I don't have time for that, I have way too many books to review. It just was not for me, I MAY come back to it another time but probably not as I will forget it no doubt.I think it would have been better if a cat was stuck out there with him too. Just for the fun factor.I wanted to love it and expected more. And yes, again I am in the club of people who don't love highly loved books. Boo hoo. I gave up.

  I am afraid my cse chemistry grade 5 aquired in 1979 was nowhere near enough to compete with the genius that is Mark Watney.Or....to be able to understand what the hell he was on about half... no 90% of the time.Upon reaching page 49 I had just about decided to call it a day. The scientific detail was just to in depth for me.Luckily as I turned the page the story turned to another perspective from earth.After that the story splits its time between the two. Knowing at the turn of the page I was going to get a break from Watneys latest astro-physics lesson assisted me on ploughing on.It is Watneys very predicament that keeps you reading. You cannot start and not want to know how this one ends.Watney is marooned on Mars having been abandoned by crewmates who gave him up for dead.So begins his 'techy' battle for survival.Some of the book is hard work and there is a distinct lack of the human aspect within.But its keeps you reading so the author must have done something right. I think perhaps it is the very story line that has worked here. Not necessarily the way it is told.

  This book is all about details. Our main character is described as a great engineer and botanist with an irreverent sense of humour, but beyond that there's not much else to say, save for the obvious predicament he's in. Weir's main focus is to talk about the details of how he attempts to survive the harsh sands of Mars. If you're an engineer, you will find a lot to love here. However, the story and characters are as thin as the Martian atmosphere, and if it's story and character you're looking for you might be a bit disappointed.If you're not into technical details, you would be best to skim over the large swathes of text that are dedicated to ""I had this problem, so I did this, then I did this, and then I did this but this happened so I did this, and I did this and finally I did that and went to bed and said something irreverent."" I've read my fair share of hard SF and I have never skimmed through a book, but I have to admit that as soon as I decided to start skimming with this one I started to enjoy it more. You can stop skimming at the interesting parts of course, but they're in the minority.

  Thi book has re-ignited my love of Sci-fi. It amused and educated throughout and made me root for Whatney right from the start. It was never too complicated as its full of technological blurb and becomes a one man show out of this world while Weir explains in layman terms all the jargon and what does what. Enjoyed the interaction with Earth and the Hermes crew and the sarcasm thrown in from time to time.

  This is a good book. Not a great book, but I did enjoy reading it...While the whole story is entertaining (Will he make it or not?), it's based on a succession of repeatable events :- Something breaks down.- He has to fix or die.- He fixes it.- Something breaks down...While this is enjoyable at first that repeatable storytelling gets boring after a while...Another weakness is the character development... It's non-existent... The characters at the beginning of the book are exactly the same in the middle of the book, and the same at the end of the book.And while we get a lot of hard science in this book, the psychological aspect is totally forgotten...Best we get is :- Something broke. I'm gonna die. Booh !- I've fixed it. Yeah !(repeat)The story is mostly told in a log format. We don't live the events directly, but through the logs of Mark. And it works...Except for the part when we go back to the third-person with scenes on Earth and on the Hermes. Specially that the book would have been even better without knowing what's happening on Earth.The ending felt rushed. While we got plenty of details for all the repairs and fixes at the beginning of the book, those disappears as we progressin the story, and doesn't even exists for the ""finale"". Not sure if the writer himself got bored writing it, or if it was a poor attempt at changing the rhythm, but it makes the ending happened so fast that it feels almost non-existent compared to the rest of the book.The ending isn't that great either. I would have like an epilogue to complete it. And just felt like an abrupt end. Again probably due the rhythm problem...So, overall. Still a good book. I did enjoy it, and it is a page turner (Will he make it or not?). But don't expect it to be a great book. And certainly not a master piece like some are saying...

  When I first picked up “The Martian” by Andy Weir I didn’t know what to expect as this was a new author and the premise wasn’t that original. However, by the time I closed the final pages I realised that this was quite simply my favourite book of those I read in 2013. It actually had me hooked from the first pages few pages due to its realism, humour and a character that the reader can find  easy to emotionally engage with.As said, earlier, the premise of the story isn’t that original with an astronaut known as Mark Watney being abandoned on the planet Mars. We then get to follow Mark as he tries to survive on the planet’s inhospitable surface in the hope of future rescue. There are portions of the story which focus elsewhere as we see NASA trying to react but on the whole the book is concentrated on Mark’s individual struggles.The pacing is perfect and the narrative voice of Watney is quite simply wonderful. With a book like this in which one character dominates the majority it is important that they are realistic and that the reader would want to take the journey with him through the highs and lows. Weir has done a brilliant job in creating Watney and at no point was I not fully behind him in his adventure. He is witty, humorous and full of a determination and drive to survive which helps the reader warm to him very quickly.  I found myself laughing at his jokes, cheering his successes and wishing him to get home with all my being. It has been a long time since I have really felt for a character like I did Watney and I think that unless you have a heart of stone you will struggle not to like him either.Another superb element of the story is the way in which Weir manages to blend science into the story in such an entertaining and interesting way. Until I read this book I never knew that someone could make the science of soil so enjoyable to follow. This utilisation of chemistry, biology and physics also really enhanced the story and helped add to the overall realism. It highlighted to me both the abilities of the characters but also the thought and dedication that has gone on behind the scenes in writing the book.Overall, I have to say that “The Martian” is a superb achievement for Weir in that he has taken a well-used science-fiction premise and repackaged it expertly. The pacing is perfect, the characters are engaging, the science is used in an interesting manner and there is a wonderful level of witty humour throughout. Perhaps I am slightly biased as Weir is Scottish so his style, views and humour probably more easily appeal to a fellow Scot like me. However, I think that this book goes beyond my own national leanings to his style and I am happy to recommend this book to anyone out there who enjoys an engaging and entertaining science fiction story with an undeniable hint of humour.

  The plot is straightforward; Mark Watney is stranded on Mars, left for dead when his mission goes wrong and the rest of the crew leave before a devastating sand storm hits. The book details his fight for survival by maintaing the life support systems, oxygenator, water purifier/reclaimer etc. within the habitation chamber left behind, whilst growing potatoes.... lots of potatoes. NASA realise from satellite images and set out to rescue him.I understand the novel was originally self-published, before being picked up by a publisher, and it has a raw unedited feel to it. It is a good survival story, but extremely technical in parts with lots of calculations about oxygen concentrations, water usage, atomspheric composition etc.It does have a credible feel to it, but due to the subject and technical nature of it I'm suprised it has been such a mainstream success because it is basically a very technical SF novel, not really a formula for a best seller.It is largely written as a journal that Watney writes, interspersed with Earth based sequences where NASA plan to rescue him. Although cleverly put together from the technical perspective, the writing is rather basic, and as others have pointed out rather lacking in depth, which is a pity because more attention here would really have lifted the novel. Some good ideas, but this is a shining example of how a story in the hands of a more gifted writer could have been much better. Three and a half stars.

  I struggled with the first half of this book. To be honest, I was very disappointed. Perhaps my expectations were too high due to all the hype. All I know is that anyone looking for something with descriptive prose should look elsewhere. While it may appeal to a certain type of reader who perhaps prefers science textbooks to literature, it will leave anyone looking for strong descriptiion cold. I have often wondered what a story written by an AI might read like. This, I think, comes pretty close.For example, about 95% of the book is dialogue. That means there is almost no narrative. I hoped to get a sense of how it would feel to be all alone on a barren planet where the gravity is half that of Earth,  where the sun appears much smaller in the sky, and where the fine, rust-red sand is in an almost perpetual state of motion. There is so much to explore here but the author offers very little description, opting instead to tell almost the entire story via the log of a witty astronaut who sometimes sounds more like a teenager than a NASA expert.What dialogue there is (outside of the log) has an oddly robotic feel to it. The dialogue tags seem to have been thrown in without any thought at all. This gets clumsy during interactions between multiple characters. In fact, during one dramatic scene I actually laughed out loud because of the dialogue tags. Attempts to mix it up a little through some distinctly Meyeresque thesaurus abuse did not help. It was here in particular that the AI feel of the writing was strongest. The tags were used logically enough, but prose is not only about logic. Prose is supposed to evoke emotion, even if it is done indirectly through tone, or subtext.At the halfway point I had something of an epiphany. I was listening to the audio book version when it occurred to me that, with almost no narrative, this was more like a radio play than a novel. The tags still bothered me but I found that if I ignored them (or imagined they were written by an AI), the story was much more enjoyable. Using this strategy I was able to get to the end and actually enjoyed it more than I thought I would.In summary: The Martian is an interesting premise told in a way that will appeal to certain readers but not others. Lots of technical problem solving but almost no descriptive narrative. If you can get past the fact that the main character sounds a bit like a teenager, he becomes quite likeable and delivers some seriously funny lines. The Pythagorus one cracked me up.

  Described as Apollo 13 meets Castaway, it's more like Apollo 13 meets Scrapyard Challenge and Top Gear.This is way out of my normal genres, but Apollo 13 is one of my favourite films, so I was willing to give it a whirl.The story is a simple one, an astronaut left on Mars by accident has to survive using his ingenuity and the remaining equipment.Mark Watney, the abandoned astronaut, is both humourous and human. His human frailties and mental strength are portrayed very well and the tension holds up throughout as some ideas go to plan and some go awry. Apparently Matt Damon has now been cast in the film role.My main criticism would be that some of the prose is too tech heavy, and I must admit that whilst I could follow the tech talk up to a point but I found it inaccessible at times.That being said the book is a great read and holds the tension just when you expect it to flag

  This book makes heavy use of sentence fragments laced with obscenities and slangy text-speak: a reading experience as repellent and offensive as partially incoherent verbal abuse. I battled on and on, hoping to extract the pith of the story, but it was like forcing myself to eat decaying junk food. I simply could not stomach it. Fiction should be interesting, entertaining, uplifting, thought-provoking and mind-enriching; this was merely soul crushing.What made this book so disappointing is that the premise is so good: one man is left for dead on Mars and must find a way to survive using his knowledge and a few raw materials- and what will happen when NASA discovers he’s alive? What the book promised was a gripping survival story, a race-against-time sci fi adventure with real science. What it delivered was a shallow commentary on how to fix problem after problem from a wholly unbelievable central character. Where is his fear, desperation, doubt, hope and depths of personal resource tested to breaking point? All the reader gets is hundreds of pages of weak, juvenile witticisms, many in poor taste. Instead of a courageous intelligent astronaut I felt I had met an ego-inflated adolescent let loose in a science lab after the janitor’s gone home. The reader must endure five tedious chapters of this before any other characters are introduced. Their verbal reactions to discovering a lost crew member is alive consist mainly of ‘um’, ‘yeah’ and words that can best be spelt with asterisks. As they are meant to be NASA scientists, there is something fundamentally wrong with this characterisation. I casually skip- read the rest. Here’s my paraphrase of an example of ‘humour’: “Hello NASA, the whole world’s listening? Well here are some parts of a woman I can draw using brackets and dots.”I have a BSc and a lifelong interest in astronomy and I found the scientific explanations dull. Growing potatoes on Mars seems far too easy. A deep puncture wound is quickly fixed with a bit of DIY surgery then our plucky hero is up and running. (Congealed blood is called ‘gunk’, apparently.) One early annoyance was the author’s references to months and years without clarifying whether these were on a Martian or terrestrial timescale. This is a very basic error. Certainly there is a need to put the sci back into sci-fi but this book does not achieve it. There are also problems with the fundamental story: eg NASA can see the Martian settlement and stranded astronaut’s movements via satellite imagery but he seems completely unaware of this and makes plans to survive until the next mission arrives, aiming to travel 3200km to meet it.I was brought up on well-written action adventure like Haggard’s ‘King Solomon’s Mines’ and quality sci-fi like Brian Aldiss  and John Wyndham. (Strange how protagonists of yesteryear managed to think their way out of life threatening situations without streams of verbal profanity!) New authors would do well to steep themselves in the classics to learn the basic elements of storytelling like structure and character development.This book saddened me and left me anxious for the future of science fiction and literature in general. If this very low standard work is enjoyed by so many readers, what place is left for quality fiction? Can it survive against such odds? I hardly dare to find out.

  Wow wow WOW! This book. This book basically took over my life for three days and I couldn't bear the time when I wasn't  reading it. Mark Watney got inside my head and under my skin like no other sci-fi hero has, and it's taken me a couple of weeks to collect my thoughts and write this review. There's so much I want to say but I must avoid spoilers because, trust me, you need to read this book without knowing anything. All you need to know is that Mark Watney is stranded on Mars all by himself, and he has to survive. Impossible? You may think so, but is there a sliver of hope? You'll have to read it to find out!Considering Mark is stranded on Mars, by himself, with a very limited supply of food and other life-saving amenities, his sense of humour does not suffer. Not one bit. Instead he's funny, sarcastic and self-deprecating, while maintaining a sense of calm and rationale that's nothing short of alien to me. In his position I would be flailing, crying, cursing the world and everyone in it and most probably giving up. I know this for a fact. But not Mark. No, Mark never gives up and continuously tries to find ways to prolong his survival. He's one of the strongest characters I've ever had the pleasure of reading about - mentally and physically - and I think he deserves to go down in literary history. That's how much of an effect he had on me!Initially I worried that The Martian would be way out of my comfort zone. I don't read much adult sci-fi (I'm working on changing that, slowly) and I thought that any science talk would completely addle my brain. There's a heavy dose of scientific stuff going on, with lots of terminology (Sols? Habs? Err... what?), but once I got used to it and understood what it meant, reading it became second nature. It doesn't slow the fast-paced plot down at all; nothing is superfluous and everything is important. We're seeing all this through Mark's eyes, and to him the smallest thing can decide whether he lives or dies. It's a truly frightening situation to be in, and author Andy Weir does a spectacular job of creating edge-of-your-seat tension. I was on tenterhooks for about half of the book, and that's not an exaggeration!The Martian is an exceptional novel, written with a style that's both addictive and compelling. I never once wanted to put it down; only necessity forced me to abandon ship (ha ha) and go to work, eagerly awaiting the moment when I could get back to Mars, Mark Watney and the Rovers. I haven't loved a book like this for a long time, especially not an adult novel set in space. It's not my usual read at all, but positive word of mouth forced me to acquire a copy and I'll always be grateful to those people who talked it up. The Martian and Mark Watney need to be read to be believed, and trust me when I say you should read this book. I'm already clamouring for a re-read, which again is unusual for me due to the sheer amount of books I have to read. It takes a special book like The Martian to make me want to experience it all over again, and I suppose that's the highest accolade I can give it.

  From start to finish, Weir envelopes the reader within the world of Mark Watney and thus within his problems.Although the plot may seem far-fetched, it is much more believable than many other science fiction novels which gives the reader a true sense of worry for watney

  I've had a love/hate relationship with this book. I started to hate its main character, Mark Watney, practically from page one when I thought he sounded less like a scientist and more like a cocky teen. Nevertheless, I grew to like him, and in some cases laughed out loud at a few of his one-liners (""Iron Man!"").I've no doubt that Weir put a lot of time and effort into researching the science behind it all, although those more scientifically minded have said it's a mix of fact and fiction, but...good grief...did it get boring. A lot of the time I felt transported back to A Level Chemistry class - it was like reading a text book.Of course, I understand why he put such passages in, to convey some credibility, but I found them dry.Overall, it was a decent read and I actually flew through the final pages as the drama ramped up a few gears, although felt the ending was a bit abrupt.PS. It should have been subtitled 'MacGyver on Mars.'

  Utterly brilliant, compelling story that subtly reels you in. Before you know it you're hooked, on the edge of your seat. I've never wanted a character to survive so badly.Just when you think everything is going to be okay, Mars throws something monumentally horrific at Mark Watney and you just don't know how it's going to end.This has you gripped to the very last page.

  OK, this book is something that you’ll either love or hate.  If you like Science then this is a book that you’ll really get behind, if not, well it’s a book that will leave you feeling rather flat.  It is definitely hard sci-fi, and whilst many readers will be left in disbelief at what occurs within, just think of it as Robinson Crusoe on Mars with the lead character Mark Watney bringing the whole thing together as he fights to not only survive against the elements but mentally.All round it’s an OK book and for me it’s one that I did have some trouble finishing as the science got a little bit too much for me.  That said it is impressive and whilst it’s a debut I think we’ll be hearing from Andy again.

  I hate to use the word bored but alas its the only word that adequately sums up my thoughts on what I thought was one of the dullest books I've read in a long, long time.The author's tendency to run and run and run with an idea incredibly tedious.The repetitiveness of 'the martian', main protagonist, Mark Watney'sfinding a problem,worrying about his imminent death - and my goodness, with so many sentences (especially in the early chapters) beginning with a certain four lettered profanity followed by 'I'm dying' (or words to that effect) I quickly found myself praying for his demiseonly, after much mathematical calculation and chemical periodic tables, to find a solution (one which funnily enough often seemed to involve duct tape as as we are informed 'turns out even NASA can't improve on duct tape')almost more than I could endure.Altogether badly written, I don't know if it was only this edition (published in 2011 by Del Rey) but I found myself quite surprised by the number of typing errors etc. And that's to say nothing of the repetitive use of language - for goodness sake the author didn't even vary in his choice of swear words.Character wise.I'm always impressed with authors that rely on one character (and lets face it though there are other characters The Martian is largely reliant on, well, 'the martian') and manage to do it well but I'm afraid for me Andy Weir didn't quite pull Mark Watney (or indeed any of the secondary characters) off. His failure to even attempt to channel any real human emotions into Mark disappointing to say the least.Copyright: Tracy Terry @ Pen and Paper.

  Too often, ""A pageturner"" turns out simply to be a description of what needs to be done in order to get to the end of the book.In this case, it's a warning: stock up on cod liver oil and glucosamine -- if you don't have arthritis in your fingers before you start, you will by the time you've finished The Martian:  your fingers will be on overdrive as they struggle to keep up with your reading pace.Weir has produced an intelligent and heart-racingly exciting novel, with a level of seeming realism that SF writers are too often unable to approach.  Even that worst fault  of much of SF, a preponderance of technical detail, is transformed into narrative excellence through the alchemy of Weir's writing.Masterful.

  I decided to buy the kindle version of this book on the back of all the good reviews and the story of how Andy Weir went about self publishing and making this book such a success that he made some good money from it and it's now coming out as a Hollywood film. Unfortunately for the first time in my life I couldn't get past the first few chapters of a book. For all the detail and knowledge in the material, it is written in a tediously obvious way and all the thoughts of the main character are just too contrived in an effort to sound cool... nothing flows or feels natural about the prose. If the character of Mark Watney narrated in a different style I imagine this book would be fantastic! I'm looking forward to the film too, but from the trailer it looks as thought the script is just as bad. Something like 'Eat that, Neil Armstrong!'For me this is a good, well researched and interesting story that sadly isn't written very well.

  Theres not a lot I can add to the hundreds of other reviews here.The basic idea is great but the book suffers numerous problems.Firstly theres Mark Watney, the titular Martian and main protagonist. In simple terms the man comes across as an irredeemable dick of a high school jock. Honestly? Mars wasnt far enough away and I ended up rooting for the planet to win and foil his escape bid.That brings me to problem no2. Watneys on Mars right? You wouldnt know it. Theres little sense of danger or urgency, it feels like hes no further away than the next town.Almost 2 years alone, 2 years in huge danger, 2 years to contemplate the meaning of life, the universe and everything (now theres a good sci fi book!). Is this explored? No. Does it affect Watney? Seemingly not. He carries on watching 70s TV and musing on the merits of disco music with apparantley no change to his outlook or behaviour. Now obviously we dont know what the effect on the human psyche would be of being alone for an extended period of isolation, on a planet millions of miles from safety, living constantly with the knowledge that your life could end any second, but I'm as sure as can be that there would be some!Watney cant carry the book by himself so we also have the guys at ground control and Nasa battling to save him.  Totally one dimensional to a man (and woman, the author has gone out of the way to be politically correct but its all so obvious and patronising - nice Chinese saving the day, stern but organised German etc) and I just didnt believe for one second that they were serious science professionals.Theres an awful lot of science and jargon on display, I didnt mind it but I've no idea if wad accurate or possible, I gave up caring to be honest.Its a horribly formulaic book. Watney encounters problem, Watney fixes problem, evverything appears to be going fine, Disaster! another problem, Watney fixes problem.....and repeat. All told with a serious lack of drama and tension, the problems cease to become a surprise as does Watney fixing them.Speed read the last 100 pages to the obvious, totally expected and completely unbelievable conclusion.Compulsive but for all the wrong reasons

  This book covers two main areas of narrative. The core of the book is the journal of Mark Watney, who is a nerd and a geek and a damned good engineer. He has a wry  sense of humour, which you can feel the character using to try and keep himself going. There is a strong sense throughout that what he may be feeling is not quite what he is committing to his journal. Every so often, as things go wrong, I wanted to shout WTF NEXT? On the other hand, I didn't feel the need to cry out, as with so many modern films, ""Why are you being so stupid?""That said, the physics and other science are rather better than the dire inaccuracies of, say, ""Mission to Mars"" and where some reviewers have complained about too many numbers, that is part of Mark's character. There is also the small fact that unless he gets his sums spot on he will, quite inevitably, die.My two hiccups with this one are that the ending is just a little abrupt, and that the supporting cast members are thinly drawn. Each seems largely to consist of a 'hook' and not that much more. Still, that being said, this is a superb page turner and a welcome piece of hard SF.

  The idea of this novel, an astronaut stranded on Mars who uses his wit and ingenuity to survive long enough to get rescued, is a good one and appeals to me. So based on the numerous 5 star ratings this book has attracted I thought I'd download it to my Kindle and give it a go.Well all I can say is that either the 5 star raters are members of the author's family or extended fan club, or perhaps they've been reviewing a different book; because I found this novel to be a tedious, one-dimensional journey.Populated with overlay detailed technical descriptions, using some dodgy science in the process I might add, of how the main character manages to grow his own food - the reader is forced to listen to the ramblings of an unlikable character during his Martian experiences in a flat, single leveled plot. In addition and whilst I'm no prude, the overuse of expletives in his dialogue does nothing to add to the drama of the story - where drama does exist at all that is!One to avoid if I were you. This is not intelligently written science fiction in my view.

It's a very witty, well written novel about a man stranded on Mars after an accident causes his crew mates to leave him for dead on the planet.

  Mark Watney is a botanist, mechanical engineer, and one of the astronauts on the Ares program, a human guinea pig, alias Astronaut, sent to Mars. Unfortunately Mars isn't a very good host.  Forget sweetness and light. Instead Mars sends a welcoming dose of Category 5 hurricane winds, which pummels the crews MAV (""Mars Ascent Vehicle"".) The crew make a mad dash for escape. Mark is left behind, with a punctured suit, (no party cocktail stick for poor Mark,) and his crew leave him behind believing him dead. Major guilt trip. Mark Watney becomes one of the first people to walk on hostile Mars but will he be one of the first to die there?The Martian is told through two voices - Mark, in log form and the scientists at NASA trying their utmost to save him. On the whole this is done extremely well, and I didn't find the shift in voices a distraction.The Martian is anything but boring. Though the title of the book is a little misleading. There are no alien beings in the book. Effectively Mark becomes the Martian, an unwilling inhabitant of Mars, an alien, human species trapped on an unforgiving, and intolerant Mars.Mark has to battle hostile territory, looming starvation, a plethora of technical, and communication problems. But Mark doesn't allow the words, ""give up,"" in his vocabulary. This guy must have been born with a positive stamp on his head. His catch phrase must be, Eliminate Doubt ........Lock it out! Forget about the Caution!I know that some reviewers have criticised this aspect of Mark's character.Is he too positive? Shouldn't he have at least one major melt down? I would counter this by saying that yes, Mark Watney is too positive for your ordinary Joe, but he's an astronaut, and astronauts are a special breed, heroic in pure essence form. Most of us mere mortals would think twice about getting on a mission to Mars. Mark Watney is believable because his humour illustrates his vulnerable human side. It is this astronaut's coping mechanism. You know how people respond to stress differently? Some talk more, some less, some speak fast, some tremble, fidget, well Mark makes a joke out of his situation.Mark just wants to LIVE. The desire to live may not be programmed into his astronaut suit but it sure lives within his heart and soul. This is an inspiring tale of trying to overcome all the daunting obstacles to just survive, breathe, eat, sleep, another day. Even if that day is lonely, boring, and full of relentless tasks. When you break it down that's all that counts. SURVIVAL. He must: live.In fact he kind of sees himself as a James Bond kind of hero.Loved this quote: ""Live another Sol would be an awesome name for a James Bond movie."" Except he'd be Q! "" Live Another Sol! (Starring Mark Watney as .... probably Q. I'm no James Bond.)""I don't believe this for one moment, I think he has a secret desire to be James Bond, the returning astronaut hero who gets all the girls. Remember it's a long time since he's had female company, this guy is just longing to get back to earth!To counterbalance the seriousness and complexity of the science Andy Weir applies it with a huge dollop of humour. Now, I love a chuckle and this book had me quietly giggling along and smiling like a crazy person so many times.Mark Watney is just so appealing. You can't help but root for him. Anyone who has to survive on a potato diet, listen to disco, (which he hates), and run out of coffee, and caffeine pills, deserves a big hug. A huge one.With no creature comforts, and an exceedingly boring diet of potatoes, (I really feel for you), he still has the resourcefulness to survive. And joke about it. Way to go.I have to admit I shed a tiny tear at the end, I just found the ending so poignant.So whether you're a total science geek, a space exploration nut, or just a person like me who appreciates a good book, go buy a copy of The Martian. I was lucky to get my copy for Christmas! Thanks to my lovely daughter.Heck, I can't believe this is Andy Weir's debut novel, an impressive first novel, which won this year's Goodread's Choice Award in the Science Fiction category.No doubts about it, The Martian has to be a full Martian 5 stars.

  An excellent story. I listened to the audio version of the book, its been my commute entertainment for the last 2 weeks. I'd recommend it this way, as the voice acting was top class, it felt like i was playing out movie inside my head.its got everything you need in a great story, Comedy, tears, suspense and joy. Its an awesome edge of your sit read / listen form start to finish. It's full of science and engineering tech speak but its really easy to understand.I can't wait to see what Ridley Scott does to the movie version. I'm sad its finished. This is definitely one I'll be revisiting again in the future!!

  This has none of the elements to lift it out of the very ordinary. No character development, no deep themes to explore, no back story revelations worth reading, nothing. Rather like a lot of YA fiction, it's a trawl through a sequence of challenges, and by a third of the way through I was very tired of pages full of figures and calculations. Shame.

  Not a bad book, but its target audience is probably young teenage boys who like humorous, crass, detailed sci-fi.The main character was just too unbelievable and irritating, cracking a joke or saying something stupid when faced with near certain death.  The rest of the characters are shameless caricatures, or walking cliches.What the book did well was the attention to detail and relatively accurate descriptions of technology, chemistry and maths.  I quite liked working through his thinking as he figured out stuff.  But I had to leave it when he decided ""kilowatt hours per sol"" was too annoying, and decided to use ""pirate ninjas"" as a unit instead.  As I say, young boys would probably love this.

  The premise of ""The Martian"" is excellent but I felt that the execution could have been better. The hero, Mark Watney, is stranded on Mars and the reader is able, through a series of first person diary entries, to follow his attempts to survive on a day to day basis and to get back to Earth via a rescue mission. The problem is that as a narrator Watney isn't really interested in backstory. We learn very little about him or his fellow crew members and next to nothing about his family or how he came to be an astronaut etc. I suppose that these details aren't fundamental to the story and we can manage without them, but without any kind of human interest, Watney's diary entries are saturated with scientific detail to the point that parts are unreadable. I'll admit that I did skim read large portions because a lot of the details - like how he fixed things - meant nothing to me and I couldn't even envisage any of what was described because I had no idea what any of the stuff was! For more scientifically minded people these sections (hopefully!) make more sense and I do think it is to the credit of the author that he has researched everything so thoroughly, but I'd imagine that the average reader (like me!) will find them either unintelligible or boring or both.The story is also fairly formulaic in that Watney trundles from disaster to disaster, yet we are never really in any doubt that he will survive. I felt that the main problem with these disasters was that they weren't really exciting, firstly because they kept happening, but also because they merely gave the author a chance to embark on more long-winded scientific explanations of how Watney fixed things (with science, lots of science). The author also has a slightly annoying habit of foreshadowing each disaster by swapping from Watney's first-person narrative to short third-person passages describing the weakness in the machinery or the difficult terrain etc that is going to cause the impending disaster!I also wish that the ending could have been fleshed out a little more as the story did finish rather abruptly. I would have liked to see more of Watney's reunion with the crew and his return to Earth, but given that the author seems to favour science over human interaction I suppose it isn't surprising that we didn't see this.Despite all the negatives in my review, I did really enjoy ""The Martian"". It's a clever idea and, provided you can cope with all the science, it will keep readers gripped until the final pages. It isn't a character-driven story though, so be prepared for people taking a back-seat to science. I came close to giving it a four star review until I remembered that I'd skim-read a lot of the scientific explanations, which probably meant I enjoyed it slightly more!

  Quiet tedious to read and rather boring I skipped through several paragraphs and didn't really miss much. The writer didn't deal with the mental state of being the only man on an entire planet  living at the edge of death each day . The isolation and stress would lead to some degree of mental breakdown but instead we get the constant stream of wise cracks from a guy who sounds more like one that has missed his last bus home from town . Very amateurish and I certainly will not be reading his next book from Andy weird and as for the movie which some have predicted !!! It might actually match red planet for tedious boredom .

  I am not with the majority who think this a wonderful science fiction novel. Back in 50s science fiction authors used to casually planet hop by rocket ship. While the author here does a masterful job of setting up one problem after another, couched in realisitic terms, this is all still as it was in the 50s - can do will conquer all, there is no such thing as as failure.Life is not like that. Things go wrong. Will there ever be a Mars mission, let alone a succesful one? Does the do-it-all nerdy hero of this book really exist? This novel is a piece of escapism, which pushes all the right generic buttons, but sadly does nothing more.

  Hm, this is a difficult one to review: great plot-line as space-botanist Mark Watney gets left behind when his astronaut colleagues depart from Mars, but the story itself is full of mind-numbingly boring geeky details of precisely how many litres of water Mark needs to water the XXX number of potatoes he needs to grown to provide himself with 1500 calories per day to wait out the time until he can be rescued... Every technical challenge, mishap and solution is worked through in excruciating detail ('I'm willing to dedicate all but an emergency 50 litres to the cause. That means I can feed 62.5 metres at a depth of 10 centimetres. About two-thirds of the the HAB's floor. It'll have to do. That's the long-term plan. For today my goal was 5 square metres').Interspersed with the nerdy stuff are high-school exclamations: 'the HAB was intact (yay!) and the MAV was gone (boo!)' or 'Hell yeah I'm a botanist! Fear my botany powers!' Clearly many, many readers have loved this: if you enjoy the kind of minute details illustrated here then this book may well work for you.

  As much as I forced myself to like this I just couldn't reconcile how the protagonist, a degree holding astronaut would talk like a working class commoner. There are far too many common slang words being used. Words I suspect an intellectual astronaut would not hold in his vocabulary. The basic dialogue together with a lack of atmosphere in the narrative makes the novel reads like an instruction manual and takes away the excitement and fear one would feel being lost on an alien planet. With refinement this would have made for great reading but in it's current state it's a big no for my bookshelf.

  Thank you to the author and publisher for the copy via netgalleyApollo 13 meets Castaway in this grippingly detailed, brilliantly ingenious man-vs-nature survival thriller-set on the surface of Mars.Six days ago, astronaut Mark Watney became one of the first men to walk on the surface of Mars. Now, he’s sure he’ll be the first man to die there.Grippingly detailed? Yep. Brilliantly ingenious? Yep. This was me while reading this book.HA! This guy’s hilarious. Wait WHAT HAPPENED? No. Oh its ok. Phew. Giggle, this guy really IS funny. LOOK OUT! Jeez. Sigh. Really? Nooo you can’t do that where’s my chocolate? Oh no worries its ok. Isnt it? Laugh. AARGH that can’t be good. And so on…The further I got into it the more gripping it got. Literally gripping…often highly funny, always keeping you on your toes – and in Mark Watney the author has created one of the most humerous, brave, versatile characters I have seen in years. You WILL root for him with every fibre of your being. You will laugh with him, cry with him, feel the highs and the lows as he desperately struggles to survive in a highly dangerous and alien environment and yet you really have no idea whether or not he will live. There are no guarantees here and I for one was desperate DESPERATE for him to find some way home.When one character dominates the majority of a novel (or a film, think “Castaway”, or the amazingly brilliant and tense “Buried” with Ryan Reynolds) then they have to be good, worth the effort, make the reader or the observer NEED to take that journey with them…or it won’t work. In that sense Andy Weir really is a genius writer – there was not one second, not one single second, even during the quieter moments when Mark is pondering his next challenge, that I was not 100% with him. All the way to the heart stopping conclusion.This is a book with true highs and lows in the emotional response department. You will either be fist pumping the air or hyperventilating through a dangerous moment and inbetween all that you get some witty, ironic and truly wonderful life observations.Absolutely and totally fantastic. Now I’m off to dance to some 70′s disco….Happy Reading Folks!

  The premise of this book is excellent. I'm hopeful that the film version takes this premise and turns it into the great story this book could have been. In the hands of Ridley Scott I'd say it's got a great shot at being a thrilling film.The book however...I'm not a fan of that many utterances of 'Yay!' in fiction.  Within the first few chapters of this book I'd counted 5. The book is littered with exclamation marks. I honestly had to work at seeing behind the dreadful character and his appalling narration of his predicament.  The protagonist speaks like an irritating teenager. Yay! Boo!The rest of the time the book reads like a dry, instruction manual. And, I grew tired of being told 'remember earlier when I told you...' when it's clear the author was trying to clarify or explain something.In the words of the author, this book is 'boo'.  I can't think of another book with as much potential story that has left me as frustrated and annoyed.Download a sample first before buying.  Unless you aren't irritated by text such as..Yay!

  Even though I'm a fan of science fiction, I couldn't finish this novel. The monotony and painful technical details about growing potatoes and every single mechanical and electrical process were too much for me to bear. I skipped ahead a few times hoping the story would have moved on, but the bland narrator was still writing logs about potatoes. They should have called it Spuds in Space. Seriously. I realise some sci fi and fantasy readers love that level of world-building detail, but it's not for me.If you enjoy very detailed technical realism in place of fully-developed and interesting characters, then knock yourself out. Make a coffee and settle into your favourite armchair, but be sure to log said preparatory, banal tasks in no fewer than five thousand words and then repeat them the following day.

  This isn't my normal genre, but having enjoyed watching Interstellar and Gravity and being impressed by the reviews on Amazon I thought I would give it a go.I found it extremely dull, to be fair as if it had been written as a diary by a scientist-astronaut! (who has no interest in captivating an audience), also the slang American language is in my opinion a big turn off. I was repeatedly tempted to give up on the book as I couldn't engage or emphasise with the character. It did get better in the final third where there was less about the science and more about the characters.

  Fast paced, full of technical information, but at the end of the day it lacked the human touch. Sure the main character had a sense of dark humor about his life threatening predicament but when the story ended I really didn't know anything much about him. There was no reflection upon his life on earth, his family, friends or loves past or present. I sometimes felt that he went from one disaster to the next in a sort of oh well here we go again shrug of the shoulders acceptance. I even found myself becoming nonchalant, knowing that he would quickly find a way to overcome his latest disaster and carry on with his journey to meet his rescuers. As I turned the end page I felt sadly cheated, it could have offered so much but on reflection it did not offer enough.

  That happy part of a successful space mission where you pack up all your stuff and salute Mars as it recedes in your rear vision mirror sadly doesn't eventuate for spaceman Mark Watney in THE MARTIAN.  An incident during the latter stages of his crew's mission sparks a hasty exodus for everyone else and a long cold solo stay on Mars for the mission's botanist and engineer who is left behind, presumed dead.  Not being quite ready to embrace the title of ""First Man to Die on Mars"", Watney commences his travel diary and brutally assesses his chances of survival.  They are pretty crap as it turns out but that won't keep a determined survivalist down.Back at N.A.S.A satellite images soon pick up signs of Watney's endeavors back up on Mars and the decision is made to go all out.  A rescue mission is planned.  All Watney has to do is stay alive on a barren planet, with little food and zero company, until the cavalry arrives.The wizardry contained within THE MARTIAN is in the problem solving.  Mark Watney can pretty well conjure up any solution in a pinch in order to survive and can see his way through all the natural horrors and survival obstacles that the red planet throws at him.  This book is a ""hell yeah"" homage to science and screams along at a cracking pace.  If you have any fingernails left by the time you finish this book, you are one cool customer,  and should probably consider throwing in a resume to N.A.S.A.  Or perhaps write a book about all the handy stuff you know, just as bitingly as author Andy Weir has conceived.You'd hesitate to slap a ""science fiction"" label on this novel.  With THE MARTIAN being written so cleverly in everyman (minus all that annoying brainiac condescension that could have been directed at the reader); it really comes across as just that darn believable.  Whenever Weir comes up with something, it rings convincingly true.  Perhaps tearing chunks off your spacesuit, employing your handy roll of duct tape and any radioactive materials that you've got lying around really can fix all those pesky problems of extreme cold and no oxygen in space.THE MARTIAN is one of those books that thriller, fantasy and science fiction enthusiasts will inhale.  Any other modern reader will most likely love THE MARTIAN too as it is a tense, intelligent read that projects you right off the couch and into space.  As you gnaw your own hand off you are right there with Mark Watney, screaming for him to get a wriggle on and becoming tense to the point of concentration tears.  It is so ridiculously clever and enjoyable that it is impossible not to caught up in the ultimate race-against-time read that is THE MARTIAN. So you don't normally read this kind of novel?  Read it anyway.A debut novel for author Andy Weir.

  I'll cut to the chase - I felt I was reading a book aimed at my teenage science interested son.  If you think Professor Brian Cox is ""cool"" then you might enjoy this - if however you find yourself wanting to vomit at the use of the word ""cool"", especially in proximity to the name ""Brian Cox"", then I suggest you give this book a miss.  As others have said the dialogue sounds like a conversation between A science students, I suppose some will like that but I didn't.  Some of the detail about how the subject manages to survive on Mars using nothing much more than a tent, a potato and a box of meccano is no doubt well researched but left me wanting to turn the page not to find out what happened next but to get on with the story a bit quicker.My main objection though is that the book has nothing in the way of character development.  It is really just a manual on how to survive on mars written in the form of a novel - the emotions and feelings of the main subject are pretty much ignored or touched on so briefly that it's clear the author is so caught up in the science he hasn't considered the human side of the story.

  Finished reading this the other night. It's a good story, but honestly I don't understand the amount of praise it's getting. Firstly I never found the main character very believable. The way he deals with every problem is just too meticulous and perfect and jars with the other times when he's talking like a high school student. He also seems far too calm all the time; you never get the feeling that someone in his position would behave as he does. There are lots of characters (back on earth, and on the spaceship) but they aren't very interesting. Mark Watney cleverly finds very technical solutions to a handful of mundane (and critical) problems, but in all honestly I was expecting far more in the way of emotional drama. The writing is as dry as the Martian sand the main character is trying to escape.

  I'd recommend this book to those who are interested in bare bones stories of survival and NOT to anyone who is looking for any existentialism or reflection in the prose, in that sense The Martian isn't your typical sci-fi fare (very light and airy, no darkness at all).For such a brilliantly researched book (the science of how a person might survive Mars using re-purposed Mars exploration kit) it's a real shame that the same amount of effort wasn't put into the characters - none of whom are remotely believable or have anything interesting to say when not relaying technical detail.  The central character is unfunny and reads more like a teenage science student that found themselves on another planet as opposed to an astronaut who has been picked by NASA for a mission to Mars after years of study, training and psychological profiling.I found it unsatisfying but that's because I'm more a fan of 2001: A Space Odyssey type sci-fi.  I'd love to read what someone like Cormac McCarthy would do with exactly the same premise.

  Plot in 16 words:Six astronauts go to Mars, one gets left behind. Can he survive? Can he be rescued?Featured on the Richard and Judy Book Club, this book has probably reached a more varied audience than it otherwise would have. And that’s a worrying thing; because it makes me grateful for Richard and Judy; and the Richard part of Richard and Judy is Richard Madeley and I don’t want to be grateful for Richard Madeley! On the face of it it’s a sci-fi; a very detailed and believable sci-fi. Readers not interested in the genre would most probably have never given it a go. But like exceptional television programs, such as The West Wing and The Wire, The Martian by Andy Weir transcends its genre and subject matter and becomes simply a brilliant, engaging read. The reasons are simple. It’s well written. It’s funny and moving. And the human story breaks through; Andy Weir’s book isn’t about a spaceman, surviving against the dangers of space and Mars. It’s about a man, Mark Watney, struggling with a seemingly hopeless situation, alone and fighting to survive.

  Oh gosh - where do I start?!This book was obviously written to be the screenplay for a film. Hence, the plot is too contrived and therefore has too many 'oh come on, it wouldn't happen like that' moments. I'm sure it's a great film, but as a book it's poor - especially when you compare it with greats like Arthur C Clarke's 'The Martian Way' which is a thousand times better.As to the science and engineering in Andy Weir's book (despite him checking it with NASA) it's full of holes.Example: All the stuff about burning off the hydrogen. a) a lot of the hydrogen will be in the pores of the soil and won't burn off at one go - which means that his colculations are off. PLUS, hyrogen plus oxygen = water (which has minimal volume compared to the gases). So the HAB wouldn't explode it would implode ...... and so on, and so on ...

  NASA has set up a chain of expeditions to Mars but very soon after landing the third one is aborted and the scientists have to leave. Unknown to them their dead companion, who is not actually dead, finds himself stranded on Mars with little hope of surviving until the next scheduled mission. Air and water are not the problem but he does not have enough food despite being left with the resources to accommodate six explorers.Right from the start this is a gripping page-turner and no matter how hard Mark Watney strives to survive Mars works just as hard to kill him. All the time I was willing him to succeed only to have yet another believable crisis threatening his continued existence. In my opinion you will not find a better thriller set on Mars or elsewhere. I had not previously heard of the author and cannot remember how I ended up buying his book to read on my Ipad, but it was a good day. Highly recommended, excellent value for money, and I look forward to reading other work from Weir.

  I simply cannot understand all the rave reviews for this book - it's terrible! It's so bad I gave up about half way through. The reason I initially downloaded it was that I'd read Ridley Scott was adapting it for the big screen. Being a Blade Runner fan I thought this would be worth a punt, but boy was I disappointed. In fact the only other time in recent history I can remember being this disappointed was when I went to see Prometheus. Hang on a minute, Prometheus was also directed by Ridley Scott..... hmmmm. So what's wrong with this book, well, some of the lines the main character comes away with are very childish, not really befitting a best in class, square-jawed, all American hero astronaut. Reams of the book are devoted to the minutiae of growing food <yawn!>. To summarise, the lead character is boring and annoying; rather than willing him to find a way home, I kept hoping he'd screw up and die.

  I liked the premise of this book - an astronaut stranded on Mars, needing all his ingenuity and expertise (and that of NASA) to solve the problem of getting him back home in one piece. And unlike some reviewers, I have no objection to the way his journal is written (Yay! and wtf etc).But what sort of person is Mark Watney? By the end of the book we know no more about him than we did at the start - he must just as well be a robot. We don't know where he comes from, we are just about aware that he has parents, he doesn't mention siblings, or girlfriends, or even male friends - just his colleagues. We don't know if he follows sport (he isn't interested in sports results when he gets connected to Earth, so probably not), nor politics nor tv, nor anything. Towards the end he has a mild fantasy about a green-skinned Martian female, so I suppose he's hetero. Other than that - ?He finds his colleagues' data sticks on which they've recorded music, video etc to while away the spare time (which must be in huge supply on the 9-month journey to Mars, as well as the time scheduled to be spent on Mars, and 9 months back.) But although Commander Lewis, and the other female astronaut, Johanssen, have brought music and tv shows, Watney has brought nothing. Neither have Martinez and Beck. Vogel has brought ""German stuff"". WTF? This is totally unbelievable. Not even any porn. It's a pity because some of Watney's comments on Lewis's 1970's tv shows are quite amusing. Could have done with more of that sort of thing.The Earth-bound characters are one-dimensional and their dialogue is wooden and functional.I was reminded of an old SF book called High Vacuum by CE Maine, written I think in the 1950s (I read it around 1960, before space travel had started.) In this book, a space ship - the first - crash lands on the moon, and the pilot has to try to survive in an extremely inhospitable environment. The book is so old that his radio has valves, I remember. In some ways it's a similar tale of pitting man's ingenuity against an unfamiliar environment.So....Watney's ingenuity and his ability to adapt to the problems which he faces are the best thing about this book. His technical knowledge seems excellent, though when he mentions the one thing I know something about - solar panels - I'm not sure he's got his facts right. He says that the solar panels he's got are 10.2 efficient, the most efficient in existence. Yet my understanding is that even silicon panels - the ordinary ones you put on the roof - are 11% efficient. And that the super-duper triple junction cells (gallium, indium, arsenide which satellites use) are over 40% efficient at converting sunlight into electricity. But maybe he's talking about something else.In short, this book suffers from the usual SF problem - it's all plot and science, and no characterisation or relationships.

  Sorry but I must of read a different book to most of the other reviewers as the one which I read was, to be perfectly honest, quite boring and tedious. I found the main character a complete and utter bore, I felt no empathy for him what so ever, in fact I found myself hoping he would end up freeze died on the surface of Mars within the first twenty or so pages. At first I thought it was perhaps the writers style of writing, but in the sections of the story dealing with characters other than Mark Watney (The Martian of the title), I liked it! If I had realised it was a Richard and Judy bookclub novel then I would have probably given it a miss anyway. I have read a couple of thier recommended reads that my wife has picked up and so far they are not for me. Ridley Scott is currently turning The Martian into a movie, all I hope is that the film is nothing like book.

  This novel is a boy's own adventure composed of a series of contrived scientific problems, thrust one after another and then promptly solved by our small cast of flat, characterless science geeks, each of whom is identifiable only by name and their individual quirk (One likes disco!

  A quick review...Thought the concept of the book was good, but let down by the execution.Watney is quite an irritating character, speaking like a neck bearded, smart arse nerd. I don't work at NASA's HR dept, but i would seriously doubt they would send someone so sarcastic up in space to spend months in a space craft with other sarcastic smart arses.His character does not change over the extended period he spends alone on Mars. Surely we should've seen some slow decline into either depression or insanity, not cracking jokes about making love to a martian queen 5 minutes after he's nearly died in a crash.On a positive note, you can tell the book would've been thoroughly researched, and seems believable.

  Mark Watney is one of the astronauts on the Ares 3 mission to Mars.  Unfortunately, when the Ares 3 mission leaves, Mark is left behind, presumed dead.  The fact that he isn’t dead comes as a bit of shock to him at first, and then he is left pondering how, or even whether, he can survive.  He knows there is another mission planned but calculating his food supplies and other equipment he doesn’t believe he can survive until the Ares 4 mission lands, and even if he does the scheduled landing site is far away; how could he even get there if he is still alive?  Keeping a detailed log of his days on Mars he struggles to set up some way firstly to keep himself alive, and only then does he consider communications.  Can he contact anyone?  What can they do to help him, even if he gets through?In between, Mark attempts to keep his spirits up; each of the astronauts had personal music, movies, tv series on entertainment systems, so Mark can keep himself entertained wondering why Sherrif Rosco doesn’t just go to the Duke farm and arrest the boys when they’re not in the General Lee.  It’s not until we’re about 50 pages into the book that we leave Mark’s log entries temporarily, to go to Earth, where at Mission Control they are commemorating his death.  From there, the book alternates between both locations.I really liked Mark as a character; he’s clearly intelligent; a botanist and an astronaut, he has the know-how and is enough of a geek to give things a go; after all, he has nothing to lose and everything to gain if he can find ways to survive.  He has an irreverent sense of humour and this comes across in his log entries.  Having never been stranded on Mars, I have no idea how it may impact on a person’s mindset; but I felt that the log entries Mark creates are indicative of a man who is a survivalist, but has a touch of pragmatism in him as well.  I don’t really know why some reviewers have complained about the bad language in the book; there really wasn’t very much so that it became an issue, and I think I’d swear if I was stranded on a planet that was doing its darnedest to kill me too.  It seems to me that some reviewers have not taken into account the mental, emotional and physical strain that we have to imagine the character undergoing in this situation, coupled with his sheer will to survive and prove the odds wrong.I thoroughly enjoyed this book; following Mark’s log entries explaining his thinking through solutions to his problems.  I think these log entries were partly a way for Mark to ‘think out loud’ as he worked through each issue and as such they give us a really good view into his mindset.  I found myself cheering with each triumph, and feeling crushed with each blow.  The incident with the airlock some way into the book nearly made me weep with frustration.  A great book; I can’t wait for more books by this clearly talented author who has written what I found to be an intelligent and thought-provoking sci-fi novel.

  **SPOILERS**Begins very well. How can you fail to be gripped by the predicament of the narrator, abandoned on Mars and presumed dead? It's a Robinsonade, always a winning formula. And the author has figured out a credible survival plan for the narrator, complete with credible bumps in the road. As a one-time physicist, I was pleasantly surprised to find that the science seems to work.The narrator is bland and one-dimensional. Emotion is conveyed by ""yay"" and ""boo"". If he experiences any true dark nights of the soul, or thoughts of his loved ones, he doesn't let us in on that. Still, even that is credible. He's leaving a public log in the event of his death, so he's unlikely to invite us in the way an unguarded narrator like Victor Frankenstein or Pip might. Also, astronauts are probably picked because they are extremely well-balanced and therefore a little dull. He deals with his fear by talking about engineering problems, and that's believable.The problem sets in when we cut to Earth. (This isn't a spoiler because it happens only a few chapters in.) Up to that point we were hermetically sealed in with our protagonist, but now we've got an emotional release valve. Suddenly there are other characters in the story and, with them, we can see our hero's predicament from the outside. This is a big storytelling mistake. Imagine if All Is Lost or 127 Hours cut away to the teams searching for our man. The very term would change with the point of view, from ""our man"" to ""a man"".Then there's the other problem with the scenes on Earth: they are really, really badly written. You know that style of superficial thriller where every scene consists of characters ping-ponging info at each other? And no character has any depth, they're just a few responses and opinions that seem to have been selected by a computer from a list. That doesn't matter in the first-person part, but in third-person chapters it's like somebody repeatedly banging a lead drum.Still, the book gets 3 stars because Mars. And the physics. Enjoy it as a fictionalized set of science problems and it's an enjoyable enough ride. I just hope the movie doesn't make the same storytelling mistakes.

  I know this is a huge deal in the ""book of the moment"" circles but honestly I found this to be really hard going.  Perfect for people who love space and space travel and all that jazz but even I loved apollo 13 and found this really hard work.  My sister who is one of those who has to finish a book right to the end regardless but even she had to call a day on this.  Too much ""space talk"" and jargon and science and not enough of a story.  I tried hard to like this I really did because the protagonist was actually quite likable and funny. In the end I just gave up.

  I really enjoyed The Martian. At first I found the protagonist a bit reserved, given the situation he's in, but it makes sense. NASA would choose people who know how to problem-solve, and who aren't going to freak out when things go wrong.Also liked the science. I don't know how accurate it is (and given its set near-future it probably features things that don't exist now but may do by the time we're on Mars) but it seems as though Andy Weir did s***loads of research, and for me that made the story all the more compelling.

  I have to agree with other 100+ reviewers of this book who also gave it a one star, there is no sole to this book.  The main character is trapped on Mars for many hundreds of days, but always seems chirpy and busy, he never talks about how he feels or his mental state, instead its like a schoolboys diary of a long holiday in a foreign country that he has to do for homework.  There is no description of Mars or his surroundings except for one sentence when he looks out over a crater before a coming dust storm - what a waste of opportunity to examine how a single human can cope with loneliness, adversity, etc on a different planet.  The descriptions of converting this gas to that gas and calculating volumes etc is tedious, boring and repeated far too often.  Disco, Dukes of Hazard - Really?  The Earth bits were better, but again thin on plot and thought, I thought the Chinese link was going somewhere, but no just a cursory plot device to compensate for an earlier chemistry lesson concerning liquids under acceleration in zero gravity.

  Before I started this book I’d heard about all the rave reviews about it and the film, I heard that it was very inventive and super sciency. As a bit of a science nerd I figured I’d absolutely love this book! It sounded like the perfect book for me. After reading it not so much.The story (for those of you who don’t know) follows Mark Watney, an astronaut gets accidentally abandoned on Mars with no hope of rescue for another 4 years. Surely he is dead I hear you say…well no because if that were the case this book would be incredibly short and depressing. Instead we follow Mark’s story of how he is going to survive for the next 4 years until the next crew get to him.It sounds brilliant and admittedly at the start I was like wow! There’s no way he can survive that long! However Mark is very inventive and it soon becomes clear that he is definitely capable of surviving on this barren planet.Most people found this book absolutely amazing, they loved the science and the inventiveness and the writing itself from Mark’s perspective. I however did not. 99% of the book is maths, SO MUCH MATHS. About a quarter of the way through as soon as Mark would start talking about figuring something out I would just skim read, I get that obviously there would be lots of intricate and detailed calculations but I feel it was completely unnecessary to put them all in the book. If I do ever get stranded on Mars with this book I will then be very grateful for the calculations however here on Earth they were unnecessary. About halfway through the book I pretty much lost interest, I was pretty sure that NASA was going to find a way to rescue him so there was no point in really finishing the book however I needed it for my reading challenge and had already committed so much time it was just easier to read it than start another book over.There were a few lines that did make me laugh but I just found the days so repetitive (I know there isn’t much to do on Mars but still). I did like that it was very inventive how he kept himself alive and the detail that went into the intricate process definitely deserves a star in itself.Towards the end I really didn’t care, pretty much from halfway through the book (if not before) I didn’t care, it was highly likely that he was going to get rescued as it would be a really bad ending to the book if Watney suddenly realised he’d miscalculated the amount of potatoes he had (impossible as the reader gets to go through each step in excruciating detail). What is the point of reading a survival story if you are 99% certain that the guy survives? You’d say well continue reading it for the funny character of Mark Watney…yeah no thanks.Basically I thought this book was really tough to get through. The story was dull and repetitive and there was just far too many calculations! I bet if you took out all the calculations the book would be a lot more readable, as it is there just isn’t a good enough story there to keep me interested. I wouldn’t recommend this, I tried to like it and see the good points but I just couldn’t. It is inventive and for that it deserves a star or two but that is about it, the story wasn’t engaging enough for me. Sorry!

  Sorry, but this book just may be the most boring fiction book ever written. It reads more like a technical manual than a story, and it certainly doesn't entertain… one long yawn from start to merciful finish.At no point did I ever find myself getting even vaguely interested in whether he survived or not – I was death-weary wading through the endless descriptions of oxygen vs CO2 ratios, flange nut sizes, temperatures, distances, and weights, page after page after bloody page.The book contains not an atom of excitement, suspense, or any kind of interest whatsoever. As so many other reviewers have pointed out, it reads like an instruction book – how to produce oxygen by electrolysing water, how to seal a defective airlock, how to mount solar panels on a “rover”. Actually, there isn't really a story at all – just endless descriptions of how he applied duct tape to things.You could write pages on why this book isn't worth reading, but I can’t drum up the enthusiasm. I’ll just note one other thing – why is everything described as “sh*t”? Is this how Americans speak (not in my experience), or is the author some kind of coprophile?Taking JUST ONE page (277):“Sh*t,” Mitch said, rubbing his eyes. “And we can’t warn him.”“Well …,” Teddy said. “Sh*t.”“I won’t ever be more than 500 meters from the Hab, so I’ll be fine if sh*t breaks.”Well sh*t, readers – this sh*tstorm is really sh*tting me now – sh*t, I think I’ll move this sh*t over there, get my sh*t together, and just generally talk sh*t for a while. Like for the entire (sh*t) book.Sorry about all the asterisks, but it would appear that Amazon won’t let me quote directly from the book they sold me.

  Absolutely dire. The author basically avoids any story by giving a blow by blow account of how the astronaught survives alone on Mars. Sounds interesting?

  Hmm, perhaps I need to change my handle to grumpyoldfatmanonabicycle.Now, this is a good-ish book in some parts, almost very good in a few parts, passably exciting when hurdles are overcome, but hardly tense. I started reading the book thinking after the first few pages that it would earn four stars.Weaknesses- well:1/ Language; realistic or not (and I still find few if any women swearing like troopers, thank goodness) the swearing reduces its market and appeal as far as I'm concerned; without it, I'd have happily given it to my kids, and really, it is pretty much a kid's book.2/ Science and technology. Definitely not as sound as the author and publishers would like you to believe. In the early sections, all those figures on how much oxygen, hydrogen and therefore water he could make are wrong- not necessarily so much that they make the solution impossible, but wrong nonetheless, by almost a factor of two. Easily disproved. This is a shame; one of the reviewers on the cover has the book as ""McGuyver meets `Mysterious Island'""- that's even more accurate than it sounds, because MacGuyver only pretended to have any technical/ scientific validity, of course, and in ""Mysterious island"", Verne at least had a good try at the science-do not confuse the book with any of the film versions. It's also a shame, because it's so easy to disprove. O level chemistry does it nicely. With the author's background, such blatant, lazy errors are not easily forgiven. When you get Sci-Fi with technology that isn't that of today, impossible science is acceptable, but if you're  using today's technology, it's unforgivable not to get very simple science right. Similarly, the Rover range- no consideration of efficient speed effect of increasing the rover's mass or energy conversion efficiencies into and out of batteries. Be lucky to get half as far as he thinks he will.3/ The  maroonee does not seem to realise early on his activities will be seen and that it'll soon be known he's alive. Now, that may not have stopped him doing what he did, but it surely would have been factored in and discussed in his monologues.4/ The Rovers with no navigation systems ? The simplest inertial system or using the plethora of satellites around Mars ? Late on, a NAV computer is described in the Rover. This would have been important to any mapping/ search tasks on the mission, so there would have been a system- even hand emplaced beacons would have worked.5/36V is not high voltage6/ Mylar is not a conductor until it's metal coatedAfter this, I gave up on noting the technical errors; they were becoming too frequent. By this time, I'd definitely revised my expected score down to three stars. By this time, it was also obvious that the book suffers seriously from ""modern writing bloat"", and thirty or forty years ago, it would have been done in half the pages and kept some excitementAt least when the software stuff is discussed, it's not possible for me to attack the weak science and technology, as that bit's not my bag; for the rest of it, there are some BIG holes in the science.The main character and his humour are the real joy of this book. Some of Watney's quips are excellent, but I never got used to the swearing. Accurate or not, it adds nothing.As for NASA, well if their internal processes and antics are anything like those described in the book, then it's hardly surprising they killed two Space Shuttle crews.While Watney's demeanour keeps you reading, and there are some good elements of entertainment in overcoming the hurdles, well, do you know that elevated stretch of- I think it's the M6- through Birmingham? You know, where there's a sharp bump every thirty yards due to the joints in the structure. It feels like Watney drives over one of those every thirty pages- problem solved....on we go...possibly getting blasé... bump! Problem solved... on we go... etc.By the- absolutely inevitable (and I seriously wondered about NOT reading the last ten pages, as it was unnecessary) ending, it had all become pretty tedious, actually.Similar subjects have been covered many times before- short stories by Niven and Wyndham are obvious ones, Heinlein's contributions, Charles Logan's wonderful ""Shipwreck"", Clarke's ""A Fall of Moondust"", as mentioned on the cover, and I'm sure many others.IMNSHO this has been given grossly over-generous reviews and a good marketing campaign. It's not bad, but it's a heck of a way from being great. Two and a half stars, and I'm so relieved to finish it, I almost have to round down to two, but maybe I'm chickening out considering all the good reviews and giving it a generous three stars.Very disappointed.And surprised no one's challenged my maths;I could be wrong.....

  Mark Watney is one of the astronauts on the Ares 3 mission to Mars.  Unfortunately, when the Ares 3 mission leaves, Mark is left behind, presumed dead.  The fact that he isn’t dead comes as a bit of shock to him at first, and then he is left pondering how, or even whether, he can survive.  He knows there is another mission planned but calculating his food supplies and other equipment he doesn’t believe he can survive until the Ares 4 mission lands, and even if he does the scheduled landing site is far away; how could he even get there if he is still alive?  Keeping a detailed log of his days on Mars he struggles to set up some way firstly to keep himself alive, and only then does he consider communications.  Can he contact anyone?  What can they do to help him, even if he gets through?In between, Mark attempts to keep his spirits up; each of the astronauts had personal music, movies, tv series on entertainment systems, so Mark can keep himself entertained wondering why Sherrif Rosco doesn’t just go to the Duke farm and arrest the boys when they’re not in the General Lee.  It’s not until we’re about 50 pages into the book that we leave Mark’s log entries temporarily, to go to Earth, where at Mission Control they are commemorating his death.  From there, the book alternates between both locations.I really liked Mark as a character; he’s clearly intelligent; a botanist and an astronaut, he has the know-how and is enough of a geek to give things a go; after all, he has nothing to lose and everything to gain if he can find ways to survive.  He has an irreverent sense of humour and this comes across in his log entries.  Having never been stranded on Mars, I have no idea how it may impact on a person’s mindset; but I felt that the log entries Mark creates are indicative of a man who is a survivalist, but has a touch of pragmatism in him as well.  I don’t really know why some reviewers have complained about the bad language in the book; there really wasn’t very much so that it became an issue, and I think I’d swear if I was stranded on a planet that was doing its darnedest to kill me too.  It seems to me that some reviewers have not taken into account the mental, emotional and physical strain that we have to imagine the character undergoing in this situation, coupled with his sheer will to survive and prove the odds wrong.I thoroughly enjoyed this book; following Mark’s log entries explaining his thinking through solutions to his problems.  I think these log entries were partly a way for Mark to ‘think out loud’ as he worked through each issue and as such they give us a really good view into his mindset.  I found myself cheering with each triumph, and feeling crushed with each blow.  The incident with the airlock some way into the book nearly made me weep with frustration.  A great book; I can’t wait for more books by this clearly talented author who has written what I found to be an intelligent and thought-provoking sci-fi novel.

  I read this as part of a science fiction book club. The other participants seemed to find something positive to say but it bored me, The author made much of describing the (no doubt) highly plausible details of how someone might survive on Mars in a very particular scenario. Some people seem to love that kind of wallowing in technical information but I am mystified. A copy of Caravans & Camper Vans magazine would be just as gripping as far as I am concerned.
